      <title>How the brain decides which moments you’ll never forget</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031214.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031214.htm</guid>
      <description>Boston University researchers found that ordinary moments can gain staying power if they’re connected to significant emotional events. Using studies with hundreds of participants, they showed that the brain prioritizes fragile memories when they overlap with meaningful experiences. This could help explain why we recall certain details surrounding big events and may lead to new ways of boosting learning and treating memory disorders.</description>

      <title>What happens to your body when you eat too many ultra-processed foods</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031211.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031211.htm</guid>
      <description>Ultra-processed foods make up the bulk of U.S. diets, and new research links high intake to inflammation, a predictor of heart disease. People consuming the most UPFs were far more likely to show elevated hs-CRP levels, especially older adults, smokers, and those with obesity. Scientists warn that UPFs may contribute to cancer and other chronic illnesses, urging stronger health policies despite pushback from powerful food companies.</description>

      <title>Mysterious “quantum echo” in superconductors could unlock new tech</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035059.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035059.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers have discovered an unusual &amp;quot;quantum echo&amp;quot; in superconducting materials, dubbed the Higgs echo. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between Higgs modes and quasiparticles, producing distinctive signals unlike conventional echoes. By using precisely timed terahertz radiation pulses, the team revealed hidden quantum pathways that could be used to encode and retrieve information.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035051.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers are showing how phone sensors can track patterns tied to a wide range of mental health symptoms. Instead of relying only on self-reports, clinicians may soon be able to gather continuous, real-world data about patients. The study also found correlations with the broad &amp;quot;p-factor,&amp;quot; a shared dimension across mental health issues.</description>

      <title>This new camera sees the invisible in 3D without lenses</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035048.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035048.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have developed a lens-free mid-infrared camera using a modern twist on pinhole imaging. The system uses nonlinear crystals to convert infrared light into visible, allowing standard sensors to capture sharp, wide-range images without distortion. It can also create precise 3D reconstructions even in extremely low light. Though still experimental, the technology promises affordable, portable infrared imaging for safety, industrial, and environmental uses.</description>

      <title>Scientists uncover how to block pain without side effects</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035030.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035030.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have discovered a way to block pain while still allowing the body’s natural healing to take place. Current painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin often come with harmful side effects because they shut down both pain and inflammation. But this new research identified a single “pain switch” receptor that can be turned off without interfering with inflammation, which actually helps the body recover.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035026.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have uncovered an unexpected witness to Earth’s distant past: tiny iron oxide stones called ooids. These mineral snowballs lock away traces of ancient carbon, revealing that oceans between 1,000 and 541 million years ago held far less organic carbon than previously thought. This discovery challenges long-standing theories linking carbon levels, oxygen surges, and the emergence of complex life.</description>

      <description>Physicists are eyeing charged gravitinos—ultra-heavy, stable particles from supergravity theory—as possible Dark Matter candidates. Unlike axions or WIMPs, these particles carry electric charge but remain undetectable due to their scarcity. With detectors like JUNO and DUNE, researchers now have a chance to spot their unique signal, a breakthrough that could link particle physics with gravity.</description>

      <description>Mangos, often dismissed as too sugary, may hold hidden benefits for those at risk of diabetes. A George Mason University study found that daily mango eaters showed better blood sugar control and less body fat than those eating a lower-sugar snack. The results suggest that it’s not just sugar levels, but how the sugar is packaged in whole foods, that matters.</description>
