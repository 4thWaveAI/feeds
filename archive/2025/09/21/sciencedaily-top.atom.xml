    <title>Strange new hybrid bird spotted in Texas backyard</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214309.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214309.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">In Texas, biologists have documented an extraordinary bird — the natural hybrid offspring of a green jay and a blue jay. Once separated by millions of years of evolution and distinct ranges, the two species were brought together as climate change expanded their territories. A backyard birder’s photo led to the discovery, and after years of elusiveness, scientists confirmed the bird’s identity through genetic testing.</summary>

    <title>Smoking’s hidden gut bacteria trick may lead to new colitis treatments</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085235.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085235.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">For decades, scientists have puzzled over why smoking makes Crohn’s disease worse but seems to protect people from ulcerative colitis. Now, researchers at RIKEN have discovered that smoking creates metabolites like hydroquinone that allow mouth bacteria—especially Streptococcus mitis—to settle in the gut. These bacteria spark an immune response that reduces inflammation in colitis but worsens Crohn’s. The findings open the door to new therapies using probiotics or targeted compounds that mimic smoking’s protective effects without its deadly risks.</summary>

    <title>Alcohol’s hidden shortcut lets gut bacteria wreck the liver</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Alcohol-associated liver disease is becoming a massive health and economic burden, but researchers at UC San Diego may have uncovered a new way forward. They discovered that chronic alcohol use blocks a crucial protein that normally helps keep gut bacteria from leaking into the liver, worsening damage. Restoring this protein’s function, using drugs already in development, could not only reduce liver disease but also have implications for treating alcohol addiction itself.</summary>
