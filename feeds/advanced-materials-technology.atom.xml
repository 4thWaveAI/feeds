    <summary type="text">For the first time, scientists have observed electrons in graphene behaving like a nearly perfect quantum fluid, challenging a long-standing puzzle in physics. By creating ultra-clean samples, the team at IISc uncovered a surprising decoupling of heat and charge transport, shattering the traditional Wiedemann-Franz law. At the mysterious “Dirac point,” graphene electrons flowed like an exotic liquid similar to quark-gluon plasma, with ultra-low viscosity. Beyond rewriting physics textbooks, this discovery opens new avenues for studying black holes and quantum entanglement in the lab—and may even power next-gen quantum sensors.</summary>
