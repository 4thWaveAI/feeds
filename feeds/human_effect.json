As semiconductor devices grow more complex, engineers face the challenge of validating performance and catching edge cases under tight schedules. Test setups often include oscilloscopes, waveform generators, network analyzers, and more, potentially from different vendors with unique automation and configuration considerations. In order to keep pace with semiconductor validation requirements, multi-channel test setups designed for flexibility and performance can help engineers scale effectively.\n    \n    Key learnings:\n    \n    - Reducing signal path complexity with multiple integrated instruments\n    - Improving data fidelity when measur",

It also reviews the regulatory environment for used HDVs import in 146 countries, 122 of which are low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). The major exporters of HDVs (used & new) are the EU, Japan, Republic of Korea (ROK), Mexico, the US, and China. However, while China manufactures 67% of global HDVs, its share of used HDV exports was only 8% in 2020. This is changing rapidly as the policy to expand used vehicles exports is being implemented and from 2022 more than 30 cities in China have been a",
