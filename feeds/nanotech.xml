      <description>Rice University researchers used a focused electron beam to pattern device functions with submicron precision directly into an ultrathin crystal. The approach produced traces narrower than the width of a DNA helix that glow with bright blue light and conduct electricity, showing it could be used to manufacture compact on-chip wiring and built-in light sources.</description>

      <title>A new bone substitute made out of 3D-printed glass</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2025-09-bone-substitute-3d-glass.html</link>

      <description>You might think that glass has no business acting as a replacement for bone, but it turns out the two materials have many similarities. For a new study published in ACS Nano, researchers developed a 3D printable bio-active glass that served as an effective bone replacement material. In rabbits, it sustained bone cell growth better than regular glass and a commercially available bone substitute.</description>

      <title>Ball mill technique produces nanoscale scaffolds that filter PFAS</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-ball-mill-technique-nanoscale-scaffolds.html</guid>
      <description>PFAS are fluorinated compounds found in many everyday products, such as outdoor clothing and cookware like Teflon pans. This is because PFAS are durable, heat-resistant and dirt-repellent. Their stability is precisely what leads to problems: although potentially harmful to our health, these substances are scarcely broken down at all in the environment and are regarded as &quot;forever chemicals.&quot; PFAS are also found in wastewater. Although they can be removed by filtration, this is a laborious process.</description>

      <description>A bane of farmers&#x27; existence, it&#x27;s estimated that plant-eating pests are responsible for the loss of up to 40% of pre-harvest yields globally. But a new generation of crop treatments that target only &quot;bad&quot; bugs could mean big gains for the Canadian agriculture sector, improving pest management tools in an industry that in 2024 generated over $142 billion.</description>
