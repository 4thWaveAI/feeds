      <title>Lipid nanoparticles enable targeted RNA therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2025-09-lipid-nanoparticles-enable-rna-therapy.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-lipid-nanoparticles-enable-rna-therapy.html</guid>
      <description>Researchers at Tel Aviv University have developed a new approach for using locked nucleic acids (LNAs)—a particularly stable type of RNA—to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. The researchers encapsulated selected LNA molecules, which silence a key gene in colitis, within lipid (fat) nanoparticles that serve as targeted drug carriers and injected the nanoparticles into colitis-model mice.</description>

      <title>Scalable strategy produces high-quality black phosphorus nanoribbons for electronics</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2025-09-scalable-strategy-high-quality-black.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-scalable-strategy-high-quality-black.html</guid>
      <description>Black phosphorus nanoribbons (BPNRs), thin and narrow ribbon-like strips of black phosphorus, are known to exhibit highly advantageous electronic properties, including a tunable bandgap. This essentially means that the energy difference between the region where electrons are bound together (i.e., valence band) and that where electrons move freely (i.e., conduction band) can be easily controlled by adjusting the width of the nanoribbons.</description>
