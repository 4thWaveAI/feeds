      <description>Wounds that do not heal are often caused by bacterial infections and are particularly dangerous for the elderly and people with diabetes, cancer and other conditions. Acetic acid (more commonly known as vinegar) has been used for centuries as a disinfectant, but it is only effective against a small number of bacteria, and it does not kill the most dangerous types.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-sensitive-nanoparticles-contrast-agents-advanced.html</guid>
      <description>A novel class of light-sensitive nanoparticles may one day enable new approaches to medical imaging. They were developed by a research team at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU). The particles absorb laser light and convert them into heat, thereby changing their internal structure, similar to folded proteins. The research was published in the journal Communications Chemistry.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-member-nanoring-boundaries-global-aromaticity.html</guid>
      <description>Pushing the limits of size constraints in chemistry, an 8-nanometer 18-porphyrin nanoring (c-P18) becomes the largest known cyclic molecule to exhibit detectable global aromaticity. This phenomenon, where π-electrons are delocalized not just over individual aromatic units but around the entire macrocyclic ring, is mostly seen in smaller aromatic molecules but rarely found in macrocyclic entities.</description>
