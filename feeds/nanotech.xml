      <title>Tiny nanoparticles conquer the big three in polymer glasses: Strength, toughness and processability</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2025-09-tiny-nanoparticles-conquer-big-polymer.html</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-tiny-nanoparticles-conquer-big-polymer.html</guid>
      <description>Scientists have found a nanoparticle-inspired solution to the age-old strength issue of polymer glasses. Seasoning the polymer glass recipe with single-chain nanoparticles, which are tiny, folded-up polymer strands, can make the glass stronger, tougher, and easier to process by acting as reinforcements.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://phys.org/news/2025-09-good-cholesterol-imaging-method-production.html</guid>
      <description>High-density lipoproteins (HDL), also known as &quot;good cholesterol,&quot; remove excess cholesterol from the body&#x27;s tissues and transport it to the liver. This process is known to prevent atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque in the walls of arteries. Atherosclerosis is associated with deadly symptoms, including heart attacks, strokes, aneurysms, and blood clots. Despite the importance of HDLs, scientists still have a limited understanding of how they are made.</description>

      <description>Polymer-based conductive nanocomposites, particularly those incorporating carbon nanotubes, are highly promising for the development of flexible electronics, soft robotics and wearable devices. However, CNTs are difficult to work with as they tend to agglomerate, making it hard to obtain a uniform dispersion. Moreover, conventional methods limit control over CNT distribution and shape.</description>
