      <title>Pollen holds a secret that could save honeybees</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250930034200.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250930034200.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have discovered that pollen is a hidden source of natural medicine for honeybees. Symbiotic bacteria called Streptomyces produce antimicrobial compounds that fight deadly bee and plant pathogens. Bees collect these bacteria along with pollen and store them in hives, creating a natural defense system. This could lead to new, sustainable ways of protecting both pollinators and crops.</description>

      <description>Tokyo residents face a trade-off between home size and commute time when it comes to sleep health. A new study shows longer commutes increase both insomnia and daytime sleepiness, while smaller housing also raises insomnia risk. Even with average-sized homes, commuting more than 52 minutes pushed people into the insomnia range. Researchers say smarter housing planning could improve both sleep and quality of life.</description>

      <title>Why Gen X women can’t stop eating ultra-processed foods</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054915.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054915.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers found that middle-aged adults, especially women, are far more likely to be addicted to ultra-processed foods than older generations. Marketing of diet-focused processed foods in the 1980s may have played a major role. Food addiction was linked to poor health, weight issues, and social isolation, highlighting long-term risks. Experts warn that children today could face even higher addiction rates in the future.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054907.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers have revealed how polymyxins, crucial last-resort antibiotics, break down bacterial armor by forcing cells to overproduce and shed it. Astonishingly, the drugs only kill bacteria when they’re active, leaving dormant cells untouched. This discovery could explain recurring infections and inspire strategies to wake bacteria up before treatment.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095654.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have shown that Earth’s basic chemistry solidified within just three million years of the Solar System’s formation. Initially, the planet was barren and inhospitable, missing water and carbon compounds. A colossal collision with Theia likely changed everything, bringing the essential ingredients for life. The study highlights that habitability may hinge on rare chance events.</description>

      <description>A fresh black hole merger detection has offered the clearest evidence yet for Einstein’s relativity and Hawking’s predictions. Scientists tracked the complete cosmic collision, confirming that black holes are defined by mass and spin. They also gained stronger proof that a black hole’s event horizon only grows, echoing thermodynamic laws. The results hint at deeper connections between gravity, entropy, and quantum theory.</description>

      <description>Human fertility hinges on a delicate molecular ballet that begins even before birth. UC Davis researchers have uncovered how special protein networks safeguard chromosomes as eggs and sperm form, ensuring genetic stability across generations. Using yeast as a model, they revealed how crossovers between chromosomes are protected for decades in female eggs, preventing errors that could lead to infertility, miscarriage, or conditions like Down syndrome.</description>
