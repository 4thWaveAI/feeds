      <description>A chance encounter with plastic waste on a tropical beach sparked a deep investigation into what those fragments mean for human health. The research reveals that bottled water isn’t as pure as it seems—each sip may contain invisible microplastics that can slip through the body’s defenses and lodge in vital organs. These tiny pollutants are linked to inflammation, hormonal disruption, and even neurological damage, yet remain dangerously understudied.</description>

      <description>A major study from Tübingen found that prediabetic individuals who normalized their blood sugar through healthy habits — even without shedding pounds — cut their risk of type 2 diabetes by 71%. Researchers discovered that improved fat distribution, particularly less abdominal fat, was key. The findings suggest that focusing solely on weight loss may overlook the true drivers of diabetes prevention.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051111.htm</guid>
      <description>Astronomers have found the most distant and energetic “odd radio circle” ever detected — a massive double-ringed radio structure nearly 10 billion years old. The discovery, made with the help of citizen scientists using LOFAR, challenges theories that these cosmic rings are caused by black hole mergers. Instead, researchers suggest galactic superwinds may be to blame.</description>

      <description>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled a breathtaking cosmic landscape that looks more like a scene from fantasy than reality. What appears to be a glowing mountain peak shrouded in mist is actually a massive field of dust and gas, sculpted by intense radiation and fierce stellar winds from newly formed stars. This region, called Pismis 24, sits within the Lobster Nebula about 5,500 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085639.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists may have finally uncovered the mystery behind ultra-high-energy cosmic rays — the most powerful particles known in the universe. A team from NTNU suggests that colossal winds from supermassive black holes could be accelerating these particles to unimaginable speeds. These winds, moving at half the speed of light, might not only shape entire galaxies but also fling atomic nuclei across the cosmos with incredible energy.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085637.htm</guid>
      <description>A University of New Mexico scientist is revealing what might be one of the most overlooked causes of dementia — damage in the brain’s tiny blood vessels. Dr. Elaine Bearer has created a new way to classify these changes, showing that many people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s also suffer from vascular damage that quietly destroys brain tissue. Even more surprising, she’s finding microplastics inside the brain that appear linked to inflammation and memory loss.</description>

      <title>It’s not just genes — parents can pass down longevity another way</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085628.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085628.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists studying tiny roundworms have uncovered how the secrets of a long life can be passed from parents to their offspring — without changing DNA. The discovery shows that when certain cellular structures called lysosomes change in ways that promote longevity, those benefits can travel from body cells to reproductive cells. This information is carried by histones, special proteins that help organize DNA, allowing the “memory” of those changes to be inherited.</description>

      <title>Why ultra-processed foods aren’t the real villain behind overeating</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085625.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085625.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers from Leeds found that overeating is driven more by what people believe about food than by its actual ingredients or level of processing. Foods perceived as fatty, sweet, or highly processed were more likely to trigger indulgence. Surprisingly, the “ultra-processed” label explained almost none of the difference in overeating behavior. The findings suggest that perception and psychology may be more important than packaging or processing.</description>

      <description>A new study shows glioblastoma isn’t confined to the brain—it erodes the skull and hijacks the immune system within skull marrow. The cancer opens channels that let inflammatory cells enter the brain, fueling its deadly progression. Even drugs meant to protect bones can make things worse, highlighting the need for therapies that target both brain and bone. The discovery reframes glioblastoma as a whole-body disease, not just a brain disorder.</description>

      <description>Stanford scientists found that aging disrupts the brain’s internal navigation system in mice, mirroring spatial memory decline in humans. Older mice struggled to recall familiar locations, while a few “super-agers” retained youthful brain patterns. Genetic clues suggest some animals, and people, may be naturally resistant to cognitive aging. The discovery could pave the way for preventing memory loss in old age.</description>

      <description>Scientists discovered that lifelong social support can slow biological aging. Using DNA-based “epigenetic clocks,” they found that people with richer, more sustained relationships showed younger biological profiles and lower inflammation. The effect wasn’t about single friendships but about consistent connections across decades.</description>
