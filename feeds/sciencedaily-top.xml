      <description>October’s night sky is set to dazzle, featuring a radiant supermoon, the fiery Draconid meteor shower, and the sparkling Orionids. As the full moon reaches its largest and brightest on October 6, stargazers can also catch the Draconids streaking from the constellation Draco. Later in the month, the Orionid meteors—fragments of Halley’s Comet—will light up the sky, creating a breathtaking celestial display for anyone willing to look up.</description>

      <title>Why ultra-processed foods aren’t the real villain behind overeating</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085625.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085625.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers from Leeds found that overeating is driven more by what people believe about food than by its actual ingredients or level of processing. Foods perceived as fatty, sweet, or highly processed were more likely to trigger indulgence. Surprisingly, the “ultra-processed” label explained almost none of the difference in overeating behavior. The findings suggest that perception and psychology may be more important than packaging or processing.</description>

      <description>A new study shows glioblastoma isn’t confined to the brain—it erodes the skull and hijacks the immune system within skull marrow. The cancer opens channels that let inflammatory cells enter the brain, fueling its deadly progression. Even drugs meant to protect bones can make things worse, highlighting the need for therapies that target both brain and bone. The discovery reframes glioblastoma as a whole-body disease, not just a brain disorder.</description>

      <title>Why the brain’s GPS fails with age, and how some minds defy it</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085616.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085616.htm</guid>
      <description>Stanford scientists found that aging disrupts the brain’s internal navigation system in mice, mirroring spatial memory decline in humans. Older mice struggled to recall familiar locations, while a few “super-agers” retained youthful brain patterns. Genetic clues suggest some animals, and people, may be naturally resistant to cognitive aging. The discovery could pave the way for preventing memory loss in old age.</description>

      <description>When cancer cells are physically squeezed, they mount an instant, high-energy defense by rushing mitochondria to the cell nucleus, unleashing a surge of ATP that fuels DNA repair and survival. This newly discovered mechanism, visualized in real time with advanced microscopy, shows mitochondria acting like emergency first responders rather than static power plants. The structures, called NAMs, were also identified in patient tumor biopsies, suggesting real-world relevance to cancer’s spread.</description>

      <description>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects over a third of the global population and is linked to serious health problems. A new study has revealed that high blood pressure, diabetes, and low HDL cholesterol are the deadliest cardiometabolic risk factors for patients with MASLD, with high blood pressure proving to be even riskier than diabetes. The findings also show that obesity and body mass index significantly influence mortality, and that each additional risk factor compounds the danger.</description>
