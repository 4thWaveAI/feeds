      <description>By analyzing tooth enamel chemistry, scientists uncovered proof that Jurassic dinosaurs divided up their meals in surprising ways—some choosing buds and leaves, others woody bark, and still others a mixed menu. This dietary diversity helped massive plant-eaters coexist, while predators carved out their own niches.</description>

      <description>Sweetpotato, a critical food crop for millions, has finally had its genetic code fully decoded after decades of mystery. Scientists unraveled its extraordinarily complex genome of six chromosome sets, revealing a hybrid origin stitched together from multiple wild ancestors. This achievement not only sheds light on sweetpotato’s remarkable adaptability and resilience but also provides powerful tools for breeders to create higher-yielding, more nutritious, and climate-resistant varieties.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250913232936.htm</guid>
      <description>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic have transformed weight loss in the U.S., with nearly 12% of Americans having tried them, according to a new RAND report. Usage is especially high among women aged 50 to 64, while men catch up in older groups. Despite effectiveness, side effects like nausea and diarrhea are common, and most Americans say they don’t plan to take them.</description>

      <description>Researchers at UBC have found a way to mimic the elusive Schwinger effect using superfluid helium, where vortex pairs appear out of thin films instead of electron-positron pairs in a vacuum. Their work not only offers a cosmic laboratory for otherwise unreachable phenomena, but also changes the way scientists understand vortices, superfluids, and even quantum tunneling.</description>

      <title>Was mars once warm, wet, and ready for life</title>

      <description>Billions of years ago, Mars may not have been the frozen desert we see today. New simulations suggest that volcanic eruptions pumped out reactive sulfur gases, creating greenhouse effects strong enough to trap warmth and possibly liquid water. This strange sulfur-rich chemistry might have made the planet more Earth-like, even supporting microbial life in hydrothermal-style environments.</description>

      <title>NASA&amp;apos;s Webb Space Telescope just found strange red dots that shouldn’t exist</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250913232927.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250913232927.htm</guid>
      <description>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered mysterious “little red dots” that may not be galaxies at all, but a whole new type of object: black hole stars. These fiery spheres, powered by ravenous black holes at their core, could explain how supermassive black holes in today’s galaxies were born. With discoveries like “The Cliff,” a massive red dot cloaked in hydrogen gas, scientists are beginning to rethink how the early universe formed—and hinting at stranger cosmic surprises still waiting to be revealed.</description>

      <description>Chronic insomnia may do more than leave you groggy, it could speed up brain aging. A large Mayo Clinic study found that people with long-term sleep troubles were 40% more likely to develop dementia or cognitive impairment, with brain scans showing changes linked to Alzheimer’s. Those reporting reduced sleep showed declines comparable to being four years older, while certain genetic risk carriers saw even steeper drops.</description>

      <description>A massive Danish study reveals that despite the remarkable weight-loss benefits of semaglutide, more than half of adults without diabetes stop using it within a year. High costs, unpleasant side effects, and underlying medical or psychiatric conditions play major roles in the dropouts. Younger users and men are especially prone to quitting, raising concerns since discontinuation often leads to weight regain.</description>

      <description>Not all barnacles just sit on rocks and ships. Some invade crabs, growing like a parasitic root system that hijacks their bodies. A mysterious group called y-larvae has baffled scientists for over a century, with no known adult stage. Genetic evidence now reveals they’re related to barnacles and may also be parasites — lurking unseen inside other creatures.</description>

      <description>Scientists have uncovered that “forever chemicals” like PFAS are even more acidic than anyone realized, meaning they dissolve and spread in water with alarming ease. Using a cutting-edge method combining NMR spectroscopy and computer modeling, researchers showed that the acidity of notorious compounds like PFOA and GenX had been vastly underestimated—sometimes by factors of a thousand.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250912195133.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists discovered that a gut bacteria molecule called corisin can travel to the kidneys, triggering inflammation and scarring that lead to diabetic kidney fibrosis. By attaching to albumin in the blood, corisin infiltrates kidney tissue and accelerates damage. In animal studies, antibodies that neutralize corisin slowed disease progression, offering hope for new treatments beyond dialysis and transplants.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250912195130.htm</guid>
      <description>Octopuses aren’t just flexible—they’re astonishingly strategic. A new study reveals how their eight arms coordinate with surprising precision: front arms for exploring, back arms for locomotion, and every arm capable of twisting, bending, shortening, and elongating in unique ways. Researchers observed nearly 7,000 deformations across multiple habitats, capturing behaviors from camouflage tricks to elaborate hunting techniques. This insight doesn’t just unlock secrets of octopus biology, it could also inspire new innovations in robotics and neuroscience.</description>

      <description>Scientists in Tokyo have uncovered “Inocles,” massive strands of extrachromosomal DNA hidden inside bacteria in human mouths. These giants, overlooked by traditional sequencing, could explain how oral microbes adapt, survive, and impact health. Found in nearly three-quarters of people, Inocles carry genes for stress resistance and may even hint at links to diseases like cancer, opening a whole new frontier in microbiome research.</description>

      <description>Johns Hopkins scientists, working with global partners, have unveiled a new way to build microchips so small they’re invisible to the eye. By developing special metal-organic materials that interact with powerful beams of light, they’ve cracked a major hurdle in creating faster, smaller, and more affordable chips. This new process, chemical liquid deposition, could reshape electronics manufacturing and push the limits of technology for years to come.</description>

      <description>For centuries, scientists have puzzled over globular clusters, the dense star systems that orbit galaxies without dark matter. Using ultra-detailed simulations, researchers recreated their origins and unexpectedly revealed a new class of cosmic object that bridges star clusters and dwarf galaxies. These “globular cluster-like dwarfs” may already exist in our Milky Way, offering fresh opportunities to study both dark matter and the earliest stars.</description>
