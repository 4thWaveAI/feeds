      <description>Physicists are eyeing charged gravitinos—ultra-heavy, stable particles from supergravity theory—as possible Dark Matter candidates. Unlike axions or WIMPs, these particles carry electric charge but remain undetectable due to their scarcity. With detectors like JUNO and DUNE, researchers now have a chance to spot their unique signal, a breakthrough that could link particle physics with gravity.</description>

      <description>Cambridge scientists have created a breakthrough material that can sense tiny chemical changes in the body, such as the increased acidity during an arthritis flare-up, and release drugs exactly when and where they’re needed. By mimicking cartilage while delivering medication, this smart gel could ease pain, reduce side effects, and provide continuous treatment for millions of arthritis sufferers.</description>

      <title>This high-sugar fruit may actually lower diabetes risk</title>

      <description>Mangos, often dismissed as too sugary, may hold hidden benefits for those at risk of diabetes. A George Mason University study found that daily mango eaters showed better blood sugar control and less body fat than those eating a lower-sugar snack. The results suggest that it’s not just sugar levels, but how the sugar is packaged in whole foods, that matters.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025356.htm</guid>
      <description>Toxic metals are pushing infrared detector makers into a corner, but NYU Tandon researchers have developed a cleaner solution using colloidal quantum dots. These detectors are made like “inks,” allowing scalable, low-cost production while showing impressive infrared sensitivity. Combined with transparent electrodes, the innovation tackles major barriers in imaging systems and could bring infrared technology to cars, medicine, and consumer devices.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025341.htm</guid>
      <description>Caltech scientists have built a record-breaking array of 6,100 neutral-atom qubits, a critical step toward powerful error-corrected quantum computers. The qubits maintained long-lasting superposition and exceptional accuracy, even while being moved within the array. This balance of scale and stability points toward the next milestone: linking qubits through entanglement to unlock true quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Hidden bacterial molecules in the brain reveal new secrets of sleep</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025336.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025336.htm</guid>
      <description>New studies show that a bacterial molecule, peptidoglycan, is present in the brain and fluctuates with sleep patterns. This challenges the idea that sleep is solely brain-driven, instead suggesting it’s a collaborative process between our bodies and microbiomes. The theory links microbes not only to sleep but also to cognition, appetite, and behavior, pointing to a profound evolutionary relationship.</description>

      <description>Shark experts tested four innovative wetsuit materials to measure how well they reduce shark-bite injuries. The results show they can lessen major trauma, blood loss, and even save lives when compared to standard neoprene. While not a perfect shield, these suits represent a leap forward in personal protection.</description>

      <description>Vincetoxicum nakaianum tricks flies into pollinating it by imitating the smell of ants attacked by spiders. Ko Mochizuki stumbled upon this finding when he noticed flies clustering around the flowers and later confirmed their unusual preference. The study reveals the first known case of ant odor mimicry in plants, expanding our understanding of how diverse floral deception can be.</description>

      <title>Brain fat, not just plaques, may be the hidden driver of Alzheimer’s</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm</guid>
      <description>For decades, scientists believed Alzheimer’s was driven mainly by sticky protein plaques and tangles in the brain. Now Purdue researchers have revealed a hidden culprit: fat. They found that brain immune cells can become clogged with fat, leaving them too weak to fight off disease. By clearing out this fat and restoring the cells’ defenses, researchers may have uncovered an entirely new way to combat Alzheimer’s — shifting the focus from plaques alone to how the brain handles fat.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012248.htm</guid>
      <description>A massive international study has shown that the experimental oral obesity drug orforglipron can help patients shed over 10% of their body weight, with nearly one in five losing 20% or more. Unlike most GLP-1 agonists that require injections, orforglipron comes as a once-daily pill, potentially making weight-loss treatment more accessible.</description>

      <description>Æthelstan, crowned in 925, was the first true king of England but remains overshadowed by Alfred the Great and later rulers. A new biography highlights his military triumphs, legal innovations, and cultural patronage that shaped England’s identity. From the decisive Battle of Brunanburh to his reforms in governance and learning, Æthelstan’s legacy is finally being revived after centuries of neglect.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012241.htm</guid>
      <description>Astronomers detected a black hole displaced nearly a kiloparsec from the center of a dwarf galaxy 230 million light-years away. Unlike most, it is actively feeding and producing radio jets, making it one of the most convincing off-nuclear cases ever confirmed. The discovery reveals that black holes can grow and shape galaxies even when not in the core, reshaping theories of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>A Hiroshima University team has designed a feasible way to detect the Unruh effect, where acceleration turns quantum vacuum fluctuations into observable particles. By using superconducting Josephson junctions, they can achieve extreme accelerations that create a detectable Unruh temperature. This produces measurable voltage jumps, providing a clear signal of the effect. The breakthrough could transform both fundamental physics and quantum technology.</description>

      <description>Researchers found that magic mushrooms and fiber caps independently evolved different biochemical pathways to create psilocybin. This convergence shows nature’s ingenuity, but the reason why remains unknown—possibly predator deterrence. Beyond evolutionary mystery, the discovery provides new enzyme tools for biotech, with promising applications for producing psilocybin-based medicines.</description>

      <description>Researchers reviewing 46 studies found evidence linking prenatal acetaminophen (Tylenol) exposure with higher risks of autism and ADHD. The FDA has since urged caution, echoing scientists’ advice that the drug be used only at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration. While important for managing fever and pain in pregnancy, prolonged use may pose risks to fetal development. Experts stress careful medical oversight and further investigation.</description>

      <description>South African diamonds have revealed nickel-rich metallic inclusions, offering the first direct evidence of reactions predicted to occur deep in Earth’s mantle. The study shows how oxidized melts infiltrated reduced rocks, trapping both the cause and effect of diamond formation. These reactions help explain volatile-rich magmas like kimberlites, linking mantle chemistry to volcanic processes. Diamonds emerge as tiny record-keepers of Earth’s deep, dynamic engine.</description>

      <description>Gifted dogs can categorize toys by function, not just appearance. In playful at-home tests, they linked labels like “fetch” and “pull” to toys—even ones they’d never seen before. The findings hint that dogs form mental concepts of objects, much like humans, pointing to deeper cognitive abilities.</description>
