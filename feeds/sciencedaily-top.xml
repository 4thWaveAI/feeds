      <title>Goodbye colonoscopy? Simple stool test detects 90% of colorectal cancers</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221920.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221920.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists at the University of Geneva have created the first detailed catalogue of gut bacteria at the subspecies level, unlocking powerful new ways to detect colorectal cancer. By applying machine learning to stool samples, they achieved a 90% detection rate—nearly matching colonoscopies, but with far less cost and discomfort. This breakthrough could revolutionize early cancer screening, helping catch the disease before it advances.</description>

      <description>Scientists at Harvard have discovered how salts like lithium bromide break down tough proteins such as keratin—not by attacking the proteins directly, but by altering the surrounding water structure. This breakthrough opens the door to a cleaner, more sustainable way to recycle wool, feathers, and hair into valuable materials, potentially replacing plastics and fueling new industries.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221821.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists in Zurich have shown that stem cell transplants can reverse stroke damage by regenerating neurons, restoring motor functions, and even repairing blood vessels. The breakthrough not only healed mice with stroke-related impairments but also suggested that treatments could soon be adapted for humans, marking a hopeful step toward tackling one of the world’s most devastating conditions.</description>

      <title>Brain rhythms reveal a secret switch between old memories and new adventures</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221819.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have uncovered how the brain reroutes its communication pathways depending on whether it’s processing something new or recalling the familiar. By fine-tuning the balance between different inhibitory circuits, the brain flexibly shifts between reactivating stored memories and integrating fresh sensory input. This discovery not only reshapes our understanding of brain rhythms but also opens new doors for exploring how attention, cognition, and even neurological disorders like epilepsy or Alzheimer’s may emerge from disrupted balance.</description>

      <title>Strange ‘leopard spots’ in a Mars rock could be the strongest hint of life yet</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916032210.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916032210.htm</guid>
      <description>NASA’s Perseverance rover has delivered its most compelling clue yet in the search for life on Mars. A rock sample called “Sapphire Canyon,” taken from the Bright Angel formation in Jezero Crater, shows unusual mineral patterns known as “leopard spots” that may have formed through microbial activity. While non-biological processes could also explain the find, scientists say the chemical fingerprints look strikingly similar to those left behind by microbes on Earth.</description>

      <description>Behind the dusty clouds of the Cigar Galaxy lies a dazzling powerhouse of star formation, where stars are being born ten times faster than in the Milky Way. Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have uncovered massive super star clusters in its core, each glowing with hundreds of thousands of stars and shining brighter than typical clusters. These observations reveal not only the galaxy’s extraordinary pace of star creation but also provide a rare look into how such enormous clusters develop and evolve.</description>

      <title>Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro makes food taste sweeter and saltier, and that may quiet cravings</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202848.htm</guid>
      <description>Some people taking Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro notice that food suddenly tastes sweeter or saltier, and this subtle shift in flavor perception appears tied to reduced appetite and stronger feelings of fullness. In a study of more than 400 patients, roughly one in five experienced heightened taste sensitivity, and many reported being less hungry and more easily satisfied.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202836.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists at UC San Diego have identified a new drug, ION224, that could transform the treatment of MASH, a dangerous form of fatty liver disease tied to obesity and diabetes. By blocking a key liver enzyme, the drug reduces fat and inflammation, halting the root causes of liver damage. In a year-long clinical trial, patients showed major improvements without serious side effects, offering hope to millions affected worldwide.</description>

      <description>Researchers from the University of Waterloo discovered that measuring long-term stress through children’s hair samples can reveal early signs of mental health risks in those living with chronic physical illnesses. Children with persistently high cortisol were more likely to struggle with anxiety, depression, and behavioral challenges, while those whose stress markers declined showed fewer problems.</description>
