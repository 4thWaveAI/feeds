      <title>Why “dry” oil wells aren’t really empty</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031239.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031239.htm</guid>
      <description>Oil wells often dry up far earlier than predicted, leaving companies baffled about the “missing” reserves. A Penn State team tackled this puzzle by harnessing PSC’s Bridges-2 supercomputer, adding a time dimension and amplitude analysis to traditional seismic data. Their findings revealed hidden rock structures blocking oil flow, meaning reserves weren’t gone—they were trapped.</description>

      <title>Living with purpose may protect your brain from dementia</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031227.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031227.htm</guid>
      <description>Living with a sense of purpose may not just enrich life, it could also guard against dementia. A UC Davis study tracking over 13,000 adults for up to 15 years found that people with higher purpose were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment. Purpose was linked to resilience across ethnicities, even in those with genetic risks for Alzheimer’s, and activities like relationships, volunteering, spirituality, and personal goals can help nurture it.</description>

      <title>Autism may be the price of human intelligence</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031224.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031224.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers discovered that autism’s prevalence may be linked to human brain evolution. Specific neurons in the outer brain evolved rapidly, and autism-linked genes changed under natural selection. These shifts may have slowed brain development in children while boosting language and cognition. The findings suggest autism is part of the trade-off that made humans so cognitively advanced.</description>

      <title>Hidden Alzheimer’s warning signs found in Parkinson’s patients without dementia</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031217.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031217.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers in Japan discovered that Parkinson’s patients diagnosed in their 80s are far more likely to show signs of amyloid buildup, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, even without dementia symptoms. The study compared younger and older patients, finding that older individuals had three times the rate of amyloid positivity. Surprisingly, Parkinson’s patients overall showed lower amyloid buildup than healthy people their age, suggesting that Parkinson’s might change the way Alzheimer’s-related processes unfold in the brain.</description>

      <title>How the brain decides which moments you’ll never forget</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031214.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031214.htm</guid>
      <description>Boston University researchers found that ordinary moments can gain staying power if they’re connected to significant emotional events. Using studies with hundreds of participants, they showed that the brain prioritizes fragile memories when they overlap with meaningful experiences. This could help explain why we recall certain details surrounding big events and may lead to new ways of boosting learning and treating memory disorders.</description>
