      <description>Scientists have discovered that ordinary ice is a flexoelectric material, capable of generating electricity when bent or unevenly deformed. At very low temperatures, it can even become ferroelectric, developing reversible electric polarization. This could help explain lightning formation in storms and inspire new technologies that use ice as an active material.</description>

      <description>In Jezero Crater’s Bright Angel formation, Perseverance has found rocks rich in organic molecules and minerals linked to microbial metabolism. Their arrangement hints at redox reactions that resemble Earth’s life-driven chemistry. While not proof of Martian life, the findings qualify as “potential biosignatures” and make the stored sample a top candidate for return to Earth.</description>

      <title>Your pancreas may be making its own version of Ozempic</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214455.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214455.htm</guid>
      <description>Duke University scientists have discovered that pancreatic alpha cells, long believed to only produce glucagon, actually generate powerful amounts of GLP-1 — the same hormone mimicked by popular diabetes drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy). Even more surprisingly, when glucagon production is blocked, alpha cells “switch gears” and boost GLP-1 output, enhancing insulin release and blood sugar control.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214447.htm</guid>
      <description>When two neutron stars collide, they unleash some of the most powerful forces in the universe, creating ripples in spacetime, showers of radiation, and even the building blocks of gold and platinum. Now, new simulations from Penn State and the University of Tennessee Knoxville reveal that elusive particles called neutrinos—able to shift between different “flavors”—play a crucial role in shaping what emerges from these cataclysmic events.</description>

      <description>In Texas, biologists have documented an extraordinary bird — the natural hybrid offspring of a green jay and a blue jay. Once separated by millions of years of evolution and distinct ranges, the two species were brought together as climate change expanded their territories. A backyard birder’s photo led to the discovery, and after years of elusiveness, scientists confirmed the bird’s identity through genetic testing.</description>

      <description>Diabetes affects millions of Americans, and many don’t even realize they have it. Instead of relying on costly and time-consuming lab tests, scientists at Penn State have developed a breath sensor that can detect diabetes and prediabetes within minutes by measuring acetone levels. Built from laser-induced graphene and zinc oxide, the sensor is lightweight, inexpensive, and designed to overcome challenges like humidity in exhaled breath.</description>

      <description>Insects are essential for ecosystems, but mounting evidence suggests many populations are collapsing under modern pressures. A new study used cutting-edge genomic techniques on museum specimens to track centuries of ant biodiversity across Fiji. The results reveal that nearly 80% of native ants are in decline, with losses intensifying in the past few hundred years as human activities expanded.</description>

      <description>Scientists have uncovered how exercise suppresses appetite through a surprising molecular pathway. A compound called Lac-Phe, produced during intense workouts, directly quiets hunger neurons in the brain while boosting appetite-suppressing ones, causing mice to eat less without side effects. This discovery reveals a natural mechanism linking physical activity and reduced hunger, paving the way for new obesity treatments.</description>
