      <title>Smoking’s hidden gut bacteria trick may lead to new colitis treatments</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085235.htm</link>

      <description>For decades, scientists have puzzled over why smoking makes Crohn’s disease worse but seems to protect people from ulcerative colitis. Now, researchers at RIKEN have discovered that smoking creates metabolites like hydroquinone that allow mouth bacteria—especially Streptococcus mitis—to settle in the gut. These bacteria spark an immune response that reduces inflammation in colitis but worsens Crohn’s. The findings open the door to new therapies using probiotics or targeted compounds that mimic smoking’s protective effects without its deadly risks.</description>

      <description>From the wreck of the royal Danish-Norwegian flagship Gribshunden, archaeologists have uncovered a rare glimpse into the naval power of the late Middle Ages. This warship, lost in 1495, carried an arsenal of small guns designed for close-range combat, symbolizing the technological leap that allowed European nations to dominate the seas. More than just a vessel, it served as King Hans’ floating castle, projecting both diplomatic influence and military might.</description>

      <description>A sweeping investigation has revealed widespread fraud in mathematics publishing, where commercial metrics and rankings have incentivized the mass production of meaningless or flawed papers. The study highlights shocking distortions—such as a university without a math department ranked as having the most top mathematicians—and the explosion of megajournals willing to publish anything for a fee.</description>

      <title>Egg-eating worms could be the secret to saving Chesapeake Bay’s blue crabs</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225022.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225022.htm</guid>
      <description>Egg-eating worms living on Chesapeake Bay blue crabs may hold the key to smarter fishery management. Once thought to be a threat, these parasites actually serve as natural biomarkers that reveal when and how often female crabs reproduce. Researchers found the worms are surprisingly resilient to varying salinity levels, meaning they can track crab spawning across the Bay.</description>

      <title>Scientists finally reveal the hidden mechanism linking alcohol to fatty liver</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225020.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225020.htm</guid>
      <description>Mayo Clinic scientists uncovered how excessive drinking triggers fatty liver disease by disrupting the enzyme VCP, which normally prevents harmful protein buildup on fat droplets in the liver. Alcohol blocks this protective process, allowing fat to accumulate and damage liver cells.</description>

      <title>Alcohol’s hidden shortcut lets gut bacteria wreck the liver</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm</guid>
      <description>Alcohol-associated liver disease is becoming a massive health and economic burden, but researchers at UC San Diego may have uncovered a new way forward. They discovered that chronic alcohol use blocks a crucial protein that normally helps keep gut bacteria from leaking into the liver, worsening damage. Restoring this protein’s function, using drugs already in development, could not only reduce liver disease but also have implications for treating alcohol addiction itself.</description>

      <description>Wildfires are no longer a seasonal nuisance but a deadly, nationwide health crisis. Fueled by climate change, smoke is spreading farther and lingering longer, with new research warning of tens of thousands of additional deaths annually by mid-century. The health costs alone could surpass all other climate damages combined, revealing wildfire smoke as one of the most underestimated threats of our warming world.</description>

      <description>Microplastics have been detected in human blood, brain tissue, and even bones, where they may weaken skeletal structure and accelerate cell aging. Recent studies suggest that these particles could worsen metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis, a risk that’s especially concerning as fractures are projected to rise sharply in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Earthquakes release blistering heat that can melt rock in an instant</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225010.htm</guid>
      <description>MIT scientists have unraveled the hidden energy balance of earthquakes by recreating them in the lab. Their findings show that while only a sliver of energy goes into the shaking we feel on the surface, the overwhelming majority is released as heat—sometimes hot enough to melt surrounding rock in an instant.</description>

      <description>A new study challenges the dream of water-rich “Hycean” planets like K2-18b, suggesting that most sub-Neptunes lose their water deep into their interiors during formation. Instead of vast oceans, these worlds likely retain only a few percent of water at the surface.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225004.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists at Rutgers and collaborators have traced the invisible dark matter scaffolding of the universe using over 100,000 Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies. By studying how these galaxies clustered across three eras shortly after the Big Bang, they mapped dark matter concentrations, uncovering cosmic “fingerprints” that reveal how galaxies grow and evolve.</description>

      <description>Astronomers have long relied on supercomputers to simulate the immense structure of the Universe, but a new tool called Effort.jl is changing that. By mimicking the behavior of complex cosmological models, this emulator delivers results with the same accuracy — and sometimes even finer detail — in just minutes on a standard laptop. The breakthrough combines neural networks with clever use of physical knowledge, cutting computation time dramatically while preserving reliability.</description>

      <title>Why Alaska’s salmon streams are suddenly bleeding orange</title>

      <description>Warming Arctic permafrost is unlocking toxic metals, turning Alaska’s once-clear rivers into orange, acid-laced streams. The shift, eerily similar to mine pollution but entirely natural, threatens fish, ecosystems, and communities that depend on them—with no way to stop the process once it starts.</description>

      <description>America already mines all the critical minerals it needs for energy, defense, and technology, but most are being wasted as mine tailings. Researchers discovered that minerals like cobalt, germanium, and rare earths are discarded in massive amounts, even though recovering just a fraction could eliminate U.S. dependence on imports.</description>

      <title>Doctors warn of a stealth opioid 20x more potent than fentanyl</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250917221004.htm</guid>
      <description>Nitazenes, a powerful and largely hidden class of synthetic opioids, are quickly becoming a deadly factor in the overdose crisis. Over 20 times stronger than fentanyl, these drugs often go undetected on routine drug tests, making overdoses harder to diagnose and reverse. Cases from Tennessee reveal a disturbing pattern of fatalities, with nitazenes frequently mixed into counterfeit pills alongside fentanyl and methamphetamine.</description>
