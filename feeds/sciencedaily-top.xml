      <description>Scientists have developed a lens-free mid-infrared camera using a modern twist on pinhole imaging. The system uses nonlinear crystals to convert infrared light into visible, allowing standard sensors to capture sharp, wide-range images without distortion. It can also create precise 3D reconstructions even in extremely low light. Though still experimental, the technology promises affordable, portable infrared imaging for safety, industrial, and environmental uses.</description>

      <title>The quantum internet just went live on Verizon’s network</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025409.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025409.htm</guid>
      <description>Penn engineers have taken quantum networking from the lab to Verizon’s live fiber network, using a silicon “Q-chip” that speaks the same Internet Protocol as the modern web. The system pairs classical and quantum signals like a train engine with sealed cargo, ensuring routing without destroying quantum states. By maintaining fidelity above 97% even under real-world noise, the approach shows that a scalable quantum internet is possible using today’s infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Physicists are eyeing charged gravitinos—ultra-heavy, stable particles from supergravity theory—as possible Dark Matter candidates. Unlike axions or WIMPs, these particles carry electric charge but remain undetectable due to their scarcity. With detectors like JUNO and DUNE, researchers now have a chance to spot their unique signal, a breakthrough that could link particle physics with gravity.</description>

      <description>Mangos, often dismissed as too sugary, may hold hidden benefits for those at risk of diabetes. A George Mason University study found that daily mango eaters showed better blood sugar control and less body fat than those eating a lower-sugar snack. The results suggest that it’s not just sugar levels, but how the sugar is packaged in whole foods, that matters.</description>

      <title>Hidden bacterial molecules in the brain reveal new secrets of sleep</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025336.htm</guid>
      <description>New studies show that a bacterial molecule, peptidoglycan, is present in the brain and fluctuates with sleep patterns. This challenges the idea that sleep is solely brain-driven, instead suggesting it’s a collaborative process between our bodies and microbiomes. The theory links microbes not only to sleep but also to cognition, appetite, and behavior, pointing to a profound evolutionary relationship.</description>

      <title>Brain fat, not just plaques, may be the hidden driver of Alzheimer’s</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm</guid>
      <description>For decades, scientists believed Alzheimer’s was driven mainly by sticky protein plaques and tangles in the brain. Now Purdue researchers have revealed a hidden culprit: fat. They found that brain immune cells can become clogged with fat, leaving them too weak to fight off disease. By clearing out this fat and restoring the cells’ defenses, researchers may have uncovered an entirely new way to combat Alzheimer’s — shifting the focus from plaques alone to how the brain handles fat.</description>

      <description>A massive international study has shown that the experimental oral obesity drug orforglipron can help patients shed over 10% of their body weight, with nearly one in five losing 20% or more. Unlike most GLP-1 agonists that require injections, orforglipron comes as a once-daily pill, potentially making weight-loss treatment more accessible.</description>

      <description>Æthelstan, crowned in 925, was the first true king of England but remains overshadowed by Alfred the Great and later rulers. A new biography highlights his military triumphs, legal innovations, and cultural patronage that shaped England’s identity. From the decisive Battle of Brunanburh to his reforms in governance and learning, Æthelstan’s legacy is finally being revived after centuries of neglect.</description>

      <description>Astronomers detected a black hole displaced nearly a kiloparsec from the center of a dwarf galaxy 230 million light-years away. Unlike most, it is actively feeding and producing radio jets, making it one of the most convincing off-nuclear cases ever confirmed. The discovery reveals that black holes can grow and shape galaxies even when not in the core, reshaping theories of cosmic evolution.</description>
