      <description>Scientists have confirmed that the Atlas blue butterfly carries the most chromosomes of any animal, with 229 pairs. Unlike duplication, its chromosomes split apart, reshaping its genome in surprising ways. This discovery sheds light on evolution, conservation, and even cancer research.</description>

      <title>Why Gen X women can’t stop eating ultra-processed foods</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054915.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054915.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers found that middle-aged adults, especially women, are far more likely to be addicted to ultra-processed foods than older generations. Marketing of diet-focused processed foods in the 1980s may have played a major role. Food addiction was linked to poor health, weight issues, and social isolation, highlighting long-term risks. Experts warn that children today could face even higher addiction rates in the future.</description>

      <title>Simple blood test predicts liver disease years before symptoms</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054911.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054911.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers in Sweden and Finland have created the CORE model, a simple blood test that predicts liver disease risk with striking accuracy. Unlike current methods, it works for the general population and can be used in everyday primary care settings. With validation across multiple countries and a web tool already available, the breakthrough could lead to much earlier detection of cirrhosis and liver cancer.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250929054907.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers have revealed how polymyxins, crucial last-resort antibiotics, break down bacterial armor by forcing cells to overproduce and shed it. Astonishingly, the drugs only kill bacteria when they’re active, leaving dormant cells untouched. This discovery could explain recurring infections and inspire strategies to wake bacteria up before treatment.</description>

      <title>Earth was born dry until a cosmic collision made it a blue planet</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095654.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095654.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have shown that Earth’s basic chemistry solidified within just three million years of the Solar System’s formation. Initially, the planet was barren and inhospitable, missing water and carbon compounds. A colossal collision with Theia likely changed everything, bringing the essential ingredients for life. The study highlights that habitability may hinge on rare chance events.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095645.htm</guid>
      <description>A fresh black hole merger detection has offered the clearest evidence yet for Einstein’s relativity and Hawking’s predictions. Scientists tracked the complete cosmic collision, confirming that black holes are defined by mass and spin. They also gained stronger proof that a black hole’s event horizon only grows, echoing thermodynamic laws. The results hint at deeper connections between gravity, entropy, and quantum theory.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095639.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have named a new ichthyosaur, Eurhinosaurus mistelgauensis, from fossils found in Mistelgau, Germany. The marine reptile had a dramatic overbite similar to swordfish and unique skeletal traits that set it apart from other species. The discovery underscores Mistelgau’s global significance as a Jurassic fossil site, with more studies underway to uncover how these animals lived and thrived.</description>

      <description>Human fertility hinges on a delicate molecular ballet that begins even before birth. UC Davis researchers have uncovered how special protein networks safeguard chromosomes as eggs and sperm form, ensuring genetic stability across generations. Using yeast as a model, they revealed how crossovers between chromosomes are protected for decades in female eggs, preventing errors that could lead to infertility, miscarriage, or conditions like Down syndrome.</description>

      <title>Junk food can scramble memory in just 4 days</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031249.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists discovered that high-fat junk food disrupts memory circuits in the brain almost immediately. Within just four days, neurons in the hippocampus became overactive, impairing memory. Restoring glucose calmed the neurons, showing that interventions like fasting or dietary shifts can restore brain health. This could help prevent obesity-related dementia and Alzheimer’s.</description>

      <description>Ancient copper smelters may have accidentally set the stage for the Iron Age. At a 3,000-year-old workshop in Georgia, researchers discovered that metalworkers were using iron oxide not to smelt iron but to improve copper yields. This experimentation shows how curiosity with materials could have sparked one of history’s greatest technological leaps, turning iron from a rare celestial metal into the backbone of empires and industry.</description>

      <title>Why “dry” oil wells aren’t really empty</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031239.htm</guid>
      <description>Oil wells often dry up far earlier than predicted, leaving companies baffled about the “missing” reserves. A Penn State team tackled this puzzle by harnessing PSC’s Bridges-2 supercomputer, adding a time dimension and amplitude analysis to traditional seismic data. Their findings revealed hidden rock structures blocking oil flow, meaning reserves weren’t gone—they were trapped.</description>

      <description>Diraq has shown that its silicon-based quantum chips can maintain world-class accuracy even when mass-produced in semiconductor foundries. Achieving over 99% fidelity in two-qubit operations, the breakthrough clears a major hurdle toward utility-scale quantum computing. Silicon’s compatibility with existing chipmaking processes means building powerful quantum processors could become both cost-effective and scalable.</description>
