      <description>A sweeping review from NYU Langone Health reveals that everyday exposure to plastics—especially during childhood—poses lasting risks for heart disease, infertility, asthma, and even brain development issues. These chemicals, found in packaging, cosmetics, and common household items, can disrupt hormones, ignite chronic inflammation, and lower IQ.</description>

      <description>Sneezing from cats, dust mites, or mold may one day be preventable with a flip of a switch. Researchers at CU Boulder found that UV222 light can alter allergen proteins, reducing allergic reactions without dangerous side effects. Within 30 minutes, airborne allergens decreased by up to 25%. The team imagines portable devices that could shield people in homes, schools, and workplaces from harmful triggers.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074938.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers found that ice can trigger stronger chemical reactions than liquid water, dissolving iron minerals in extreme cold. Freeze-thaw cycles amplify the effect, releasing iron into rivers and soils. With climate change accelerating these cycles, Arctic waterways may face major transformations.</description>

      <title>Scientists finally capture water’s hidden state that’s both solid and liquid</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074936.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074936.htm</guid>
      <description>Water, though familiar, still hides astonishing secrets. When squeezed into nanosized channels, it can enter a bizarre “premelting state” that is both solid and liquid at once. Using advanced NMR techniques, Japanese researchers directly observed this strange new phase, revealing that confined water molecules move like a liquid while maintaining solid-like order.</description>

      <title>A hormone that silences the immune system may unlock new cancer treatments</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921091002.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921091002.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have discovered that cancer uses a hidden hormone to switch off the body’s natural defenses, allowing tumors to grow unchecked. By uncovering this secret signal, they found a way to block it and restore the immune system’s ability to fight back. The breakthrough not only hints at powerful new cancer treatments but also suggests the same pathway could someday be used to calm autoimmune diseases.</description>

      <title>When cancer cells feel squeezed, they become more dangerous</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090904.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090904.htm</guid>
      <description>New research shows that cancer cells don’t just grow; they adapt when stressed. When squeezed inside tissues, they transform into more invasive, drug-resistant versions of themselves. A protein called HMGB2 helps flip this dangerous switch, giving the cells new powers to escape. The findings reveal how the tumor’s environment itself can drive cancer’s deadly flexibility.</description>

      <description>Researchers have shown that a green-Mediterranean diet can help slow brain aging. By analyzing data from the DIRECT PLUS trial, scientists found reduced levels of proteins tied to faster brain decline among those consuming green tea and Mankai. The results point to anti-inflammatory compounds as key protectors of brain health. This diet may be a powerful tool for preserving cognitive function.</description>

      <title>Why alcohol blocks the liver from healing, even after you quit</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090859.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090859.htm</guid>
      <description>Alcohol doesn’t just damage the liver — it locks its cells in a strange “in-between” state that prevents them from healing. Even after someone quits drinking, liver cells often get stuck, unable to function normally or regenerate. Scientists have now traced this problem to runaway inflammation, which scrambles the cell’s instructions and silences a key helper protein. By blocking these inflammatory signals in lab tests, they were able to restore the liver’s healing ability — a finding that could point to new treatments beyond transplants.</description>

      <description>More than a century after its discovery, a mysterious fossil from South Wales has finally been confirmed as belonging to a new species of predatory dinosaur. Using cutting-edge digital scanning, researchers reconstructed the long-lost jawbone, revealing unique features that warranted a new name: Newtonsaurus.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090853.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have developed a new multi-layered metalens design that could revolutionize portable optics in devices like phones, drones, and satellites. By stacking metamaterial layers instead of relying on a single one, the team overcame fundamental limits in focusing multiple wavelengths of light. Their algorithm-driven approach produced intricate nanostructures shaped like clovers, propellers, and squares, enabling improved performance, scalability, and polarization independence.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090846.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have discovered that ordinary ice is a flexoelectric material, capable of generating electricity when bent or unevenly deformed. At very low temperatures, it can even become ferroelectric, developing reversible electric polarization. This could help explain lightning formation in storms and inspire new technologies that use ice as an active material.</description>

      <title>Your pancreas may be making its own version of Ozempic</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214455.htm</guid>
      <description>Duke University scientists have discovered that pancreatic alpha cells, long believed to only produce glucagon, actually generate powerful amounts of GLP-1 — the same hormone mimicked by popular diabetes drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy). Even more surprisingly, when glucagon production is blocked, alpha cells “switch gears” and boost GLP-1 output, enhancing insulin release and blood sugar control.</description>

      <description>When two neutron stars collide, they unleash some of the most powerful forces in the universe, creating ripples in spacetime, showers of radiation, and even the building blocks of gold and platinum. Now, new simulations from Penn State and the University of Tennessee Knoxville reveal that elusive particles called neutrinos—able to shift between different “flavors”—play a crucial role in shaping what emerges from these cataclysmic events.</description>
