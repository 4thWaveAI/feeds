      <description>Warming Arctic permafrost is unlocking toxic metals, turning Alaska’s once-clear rivers into orange, acid-laced streams. The shift, eerily similar to mine pollution but entirely natural, threatens fish, ecosystems, and communities that depend on them—with no way to stop the process once it starts.</description>

      <title>Goodbye colonoscopy? Simple stool test detects 90% of colorectal cancers</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221920.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221920.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists at the University of Geneva have created the first detailed catalogue of gut bacteria at the subspecies level, unlocking powerful new ways to detect colorectal cancer. By applying machine learning to stool samples, they achieved a 90% detection rate—nearly matching colonoscopies, but with far less cost and discomfort. This breakthrough could revolutionize early cancer screening, helping catch the disease before it advances.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221819.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have uncovered how the brain reroutes its communication pathways depending on whether it’s processing something new or recalling the familiar. By fine-tuning the balance between different inhibitory circuits, the brain flexibly shifts between reactivating stored memories and integrating fresh sensory input. This discovery not only reshapes our understanding of brain rhythms but also opens new doors for exploring how attention, cognition, and even neurological disorders like epilepsy or Alzheimer’s may emerge from disrupted balance.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916032210.htm</guid>
      <description>NASA’s Perseverance rover has delivered its most compelling clue yet in the search for life on Mars. A rock sample called “Sapphire Canyon,” taken from the Bright Angel formation in Jezero Crater, shows unusual mineral patterns known as “leopard spots” that may have formed through microbial activity. While non-biological processes could also explain the find, scientists say the chemical fingerprints look strikingly similar to those left behind by microbes on Earth.</description>

      <description>Behind the dusty clouds of the Cigar Galaxy lies a dazzling powerhouse of star formation, where stars are being born ten times faster than in the Milky Way. Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have uncovered massive super star clusters in its core, each glowing with hundreds of thousands of stars and shining brighter than typical clusters. These observations reveal not only the galaxy’s extraordinary pace of star creation but also provide a rare look into how such enormous clusters develop and evolve.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202848.htm</guid>
      <description>Some people taking Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro notice that food suddenly tastes sweeter or saltier, and this subtle shift in flavor perception appears tied to reduced appetite and stronger feelings of fullness. In a study of more than 400 patients, roughly one in five experienced heightened taste sensitivity, and many reported being less hungry and more easily satisfied.</description>
