      <title>Brain fat, not just plaques, may be the hidden driver of Alzheimer’s</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm</link>

      <description>For decades, scientists believed Alzheimer’s was driven mainly by sticky protein plaques and tangles in the brain. Now Purdue researchers have revealed a hidden culprit: fat. They found that brain immune cells can become clogged with fat, leaving them too weak to fight off disease. By clearing out this fat and restoring the cells’ defenses, researchers may have uncovered an entirely new way to combat Alzheimer’s — shifting the focus from plaques alone to how the brain handles fat.</description>

      <description>A massive international study has shown that the experimental oral obesity drug orforglipron can help patients shed over 10% of their body weight, with nearly one in five losing 20% or more. Unlike most GLP-1 agonists that require injections, orforglipron comes as a once-daily pill, potentially making weight-loss treatment more accessible.</description>

      <description>Æthelstan, crowned in 925, was the first true king of England but remains overshadowed by Alfred the Great and later rulers. A new biography highlights his military triumphs, legal innovations, and cultural patronage that shaped England’s identity. From the decisive Battle of Brunanburh to his reforms in governance and learning, Æthelstan’s legacy is finally being revived after centuries of neglect.</description>

      <title>A rogue black hole is beaming energy from a nearby dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012241.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012241.htm</guid>
      <description>Astronomers detected a black hole displaced nearly a kiloparsec from the center of a dwarf galaxy 230 million light-years away. Unlike most, it is actively feeding and producing radio jets, making it one of the most convincing off-nuclear cases ever confirmed. The discovery reveals that black holes can grow and shape galaxies even when not in the core, reshaping theories of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>A Hiroshima University team has designed a feasible way to detect the Unruh effect, where acceleration turns quantum vacuum fluctuations into observable particles. By using superconducting Josephson junctions, they can achieve extreme accelerations that create a detectable Unruh temperature. This produces measurable voltage jumps, providing a clear signal of the effect. The breakthrough could transform both fundamental physics and quantum technology.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012226.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers found that magic mushrooms and fiber caps independently evolved different biochemical pathways to create psilocybin. This convergence shows nature’s ingenuity, but the reason why remains unknown—possibly predator deterrence. Beyond evolutionary mystery, the discovery provides new enzyme tools for biotech, with promising applications for producing psilocybin-based medicines.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012222.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers reviewing 46 studies found evidence linking prenatal acetaminophen (Tylenol) exposure with higher risks of autism and ADHD. The FDA has since urged caution, echoing scientists’ advice that the drug be used only at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration. While important for managing fever and pain in pregnancy, prolonged use may pose risks to fetal development. Experts stress careful medical oversight and further investigation.</description>

      <description>South African diamonds have revealed nickel-rich metallic inclusions, offering the first direct evidence of reactions predicted to occur deep in Earth’s mantle. The study shows how oxidized melts infiltrated reduced rocks, trapping both the cause and effect of diamond formation. These reactions help explain volatile-rich magmas like kimberlites, linking mantle chemistry to volcanic processes. Diamonds emerge as tiny record-keepers of Earth’s deep, dynamic engine.</description>

      <description>Researchers have shown that stress and retrovirus levels are tightly linked to disease in koalas. High KoRV loads make koalas more vulnerable to chlamydia, worsening epidemics in stressed populations. Protecting habitats, careful breeding, and antiviral trials are now being pursued to give koalas a fighting chance at survival.</description>

      <description>Primordial magnetic fields, billions of times weaker than a fridge magnet, may have left lasting imprints on the Universe. Researchers ran over 250,000 simulations to show how these fields shaped the cosmic web, then validated the results with observations. Their study sets a stricter upper limit on the fields’ strength, aligning with other data and suggesting important consequences for early star and galaxy formation.</description>

      <description>A 95-million-year-old crocodyliform fossil, affectionately nicknamed Elton, was discovered in Montana by student Harrison Allen. Unlike most crocs, it lived on land and ate a varied diet. The find led to the naming of a new species, Thikarisuchus xenodentes, offering insights into croc evolution and burrow-based fossil preservation. For Allen, it was a life-changing project that launched him into a career in paleontology.</description>
