      <description>South African diamonds have revealed nickel-rich metallic inclusions, offering the first direct evidence of reactions predicted to occur deep in Earth’s mantle. The study shows how oxidized melts infiltrated reduced rocks, trapping both the cause and effect of diamond formation. These reactions help explain volatile-rich magmas like kimberlites, linking mantle chemistry to volcanic processes. Diamonds emerge as tiny record-keepers of Earth’s deep, dynamic engine.</description>

      <description>Gifted dogs can categorize toys by function, not just appearance. In playful at-home tests, they linked labels like “fetch” and “pull” to toys—even ones they’d never seen before. The findings hint that dogs form mental concepts of objects, much like humans, pointing to deeper cognitive abilities.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250923021207.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers have shown that stress and retrovirus levels are tightly linked to disease in koalas. High KoRV loads make koalas more vulnerable to chlamydia, worsening epidemics in stressed populations. Protecting habitats, careful breeding, and antiviral trials are now being pursued to give koalas a fighting chance at survival.</description>

      <description>Curiosity is exploring Mars’ boxwork terrain, where ridges and hollows may have formed from cementation and erosion. The rover has been documenting rock textures and chemistry, comparing smoother ridge rocks with nodular hollow-edge rocks. Scientists are weighing drill sites while also monitoring dust, clouds, and long-distance features across Gale Crater.</description>

      <description>Primordial magnetic fields, billions of times weaker than a fridge magnet, may have left lasting imprints on the Universe. Researchers ran over 250,000 simulations to show how these fields shaped the cosmic web, then validated the results with observations. Their study sets a stricter upper limit on the fields’ strength, aligning with other data and suggesting important consequences for early star and galaxy formation.</description>

      <description>A 95-million-year-old crocodyliform fossil, affectionately nicknamed Elton, was discovered in Montana by student Harrison Allen. Unlike most crocs, it lived on land and ate a varied diet. The find led to the naming of a new species, Thikarisuchus xenodentes, offering insights into croc evolution and burrow-based fossil preservation. For Allen, it was a life-changing project that launched him into a career in paleontology.</description>

      <description>Not drinking enough water could intensify stress responses. Researchers found that under-hydrated individuals had cortisol levels more than 50% higher during stressful situations. Poor hydration didn’t make participants feel thirstier, but it did trigger biological signs of strain. Keeping a water bottle handy could help manage stress and safeguard health.</description>

      <description>For more than a century, a dazzling pink-and-yellow moth was mistaken for a common European species, but DNA analysis revealed it as entirely new: Carcina ingridmariae. Found across the eastern Mediterranean, this hidden beauty had evaded recognition until advanced barcoding techniques exposed its genetic secrets. Entomologist Dr. Peter Huemer confirmed the discovery and, in a heartfelt gesture, named the moth after his wife on their 42nd anniversary, celebrating both science and love.</description>

      <description>A long-term study in Colorado reveals that insect populations are plummeting even in remote, undisturbed areas. Over two decades, flying insect abundance dropped by more than 70%, closely linked to rising summer temperatures. The results suggest that climate change, not just human land use, is driving massive losses. Scientists warn that biodiversity hotspots, especially mountain ecosystems, are now at serious risk.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074954.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers found that pancreatic pre-cancer cells mimic dementia by forming clumps of proteins due to faulty recycling processes. These insights could shed light on why pancreatic cancer develops so aggressively and why it is difficult to treat. By studying overlaps with neurological diseases, scientists hope to identify new strategies for prevention and treatment.</description>

      <title>Hidden brain signal reveals Alzheimer’s years before symptoms</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074952.htm</guid>
      <description>A new study has revealed that TSPO, a protein linked to brain inflammation, rises long before Alzheimer’s symptoms appear. Researchers tracked the protein in genetically engineered mice and confirmed the results in human brain tissue from Colombian families with a known Alzheimer’s mutation. They found unusually high levels of TSPO in microglia clustered around plaques, particularly in women. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of the disease but also sparks the possibility of using TSPO to detect and treat Alzheimer’s far earlier than ever before.</description>

      <description>A team at RMIT University has created a cement-free construction material using only cardboard, soil, and water. Strong enough for low-rise buildings, it reduces emissions, costs, and waste compared to concrete. The lightweight, on-site process makes it ideal for remote areas, while its thermal properties naturally cool buildings. Researchers see it as a key step toward greener, more resilient architecture.</description>

      <description>A sweeping review from NYU Langone Health reveals that everyday exposure to plastics—especially during childhood—poses lasting risks for heart disease, infertility, asthma, and even brain development issues. These chemicals, found in packaging, cosmetics, and common household items, can disrupt hormones, ignite chronic inflammation, and lower IQ.</description>

      <description>Sneezing from cats, dust mites, or mold may one day be preventable with a flip of a switch. Researchers at CU Boulder found that UV222 light can alter allergen proteins, reducing allergic reactions without dangerous side effects. Within 30 minutes, airborne allergens decreased by up to 25%. The team imagines portable devices that could shield people in homes, schools, and workplaces from harmful triggers.</description>

      <description>Researchers found that ice can trigger stronger chemical reactions than liquid water, dissolving iron minerals in extreme cold. Freeze-thaw cycles amplify the effect, releasing iron into rivers and soils. With climate change accelerating these cycles, Arctic waterways may face major transformations.</description>

      <description>Water, though familiar, still hides astonishing secrets. When squeezed into nanosized channels, it can enter a bizarre “premelting state” that is both solid and liquid at once. Using advanced NMR techniques, Japanese researchers directly observed this strange new phase, revealing that confined water molecules move like a liquid while maintaining solid-like order.</description>
