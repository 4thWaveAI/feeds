      <title>Strange ‘leopard spots’ in a Mars rock could be the strongest hint of life yet</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916032210.htm</link>

      <description>NASA’s Perseverance rover has delivered its most compelling clue yet in the search for life on Mars. A rock sample called “Sapphire Canyon,” taken from the Bright Angel formation in Jezero Crater, shows unusual mineral patterns known as “leopard spots” that may have formed through microbial activity. While non-biological processes could also explain the find, scientists say the chemical fingerprints look strikingly similar to those left behind by microbes on Earth.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915205900.htm</guid>
      <description>Behind the dusty clouds of the Cigar Galaxy lies a dazzling powerhouse of star formation, where stars are being born ten times faster than in the Milky Way. Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have uncovered massive super star clusters in its core, each glowing with hundreds of thousands of stars and shining brighter than typical clusters. These observations reveal not only the galaxy’s extraordinary pace of star creation but also provide a rare look into how such enormous clusters develop and evolve.</description>

      <title>Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro makes food taste sweeter and saltier, and that may quiet cravings</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202848.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202848.htm</guid>
      <description>Some people taking Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro notice that food suddenly tastes sweeter or saltier, and this subtle shift in flavor perception appears tied to reduced appetite and stronger feelings of fullness. In a study of more than 400 patients, roughly one in five experienced heightened taste sensitivity, and many reported being less hungry and more easily satisfied.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202839.htm</guid>
      <description>Preschoolers with ADHD are often given medication right after diagnosis, against medical guidelines that recommend starting with behavioral therapy. Limited access to therapy and physician pressures drive early prescribing, despite risks and reduced effectiveness in young children.</description>

      <title>New drug could be first to stop deadly fatty liver disease</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202836.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202836.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists at UC San Diego have identified a new drug, ION224, that could transform the treatment of MASH, a dangerous form of fatty liver disease tied to obesity and diabetes. By blocking a key liver enzyme, the drug reduces fat and inflammation, halting the root causes of liver damage. In a year-long clinical trial, patients showed major improvements without serious side effects, offering hope to millions affected worldwide.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202834.htm</guid>
      <description>Researchers from the University of Waterloo discovered that measuring long-term stress through children’s hair samples can reveal early signs of mental health risks in those living with chronic physical illnesses. Children with persistently high cortisol were more likely to struggle with anxiety, depression, and behavioral challenges, while those whose stress markers declined showed fewer problems.</description>

      <description>Volcanic eruptions on the remote island of Nishinoshima repeatedly wipe the land clean, giving scientists a rare chance to study life’s earliest stages. Researchers traced the genetic origins of an extinct purslane population to nearby Chichijima but found striking quirks—evidence of a founder’s effect and genetic drift. These discoveries shed light on how plants recolonize harsh environments and how ecosystems evolve from scratch.</description>

      <title>Who are the Papua New Guineans? New DNA study reveals stunning origins</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205853.htm</guid>
      <description>On remote islands of Papua New Guinea, people carry a story that ties us all back to our deepest roots. Although their striking appearance once puzzled scientists, new genetic evidence shows they share a common ancestry with other Asians, shaped by isolation, adaptation, and even interbreeding with mysterious Denisovans. Yet, their unique history — marked by survival bottlenecks and separation from farming-driven booms — leaves open questions about the earliest migrations out of Africa and whether their lineage holds traces of a forgotten branch of humanity.</description>

      <description>Dry eyes are far more common than previously believed, with over half of adults in the US and Europe experiencing symptoms, yet most remain undiagnosed for years. The large-scale NESTS study reveals that sufferers often endure daily discomfort that disrupts work, driving, and even surgery outcomes. Many accept the condition as part of aging, unaware that simple treatments could provide relief.</description>
