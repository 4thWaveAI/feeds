      <description>In 2020, California’s Creek Fire became so intense that it generated its own thunderstorm, a phenomenon called a pyrocumulonimbus cloud. For years, scientists struggled to replicate these explosive fire-born storms in climate models, leaving major gaps in understanding their global effects. Now, a new study has finally simulated them successfully, reproducing the Creek Fire’s storm and others like it.</description>

      <title>A single dose of psilocybin may rewire the brain for lasting relief</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251002073959.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251002073959.htm</guid>
      <description>Penn researchers found that psilocybin can calm brain circuits tied to pain and mood, easing both physical suffering and emotional distress in animal studies. The compound works in the anterior cingulate cortex, bypassing injury sites and offering a dual benefit for pain and depression. Unlike opioids, psilocybin is non-addictive and may provide relief lasting weeks.</description>

      <title>How gaslighting tricks the brain into questioning reality</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092238.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092238.htm</guid>
      <description>Gaslighting, often seen as a form of manipulation, has now been reframed by researchers at McGill University and the University of Toronto as a learning process rooted in how our brains handle prediction and surprise. Instead of merely being explained through outdated psychodynamic theories, this new model highlights how trust and close relationships can be exploited by manipulators who repeatedly undermine a person’s confidence in their own reality.</description>

      <description>BMJ Group has pulled a widely reported apple cider vinegar weight-loss study after experts uncovered major flaws in its data and analysis. Attempts to replicate the results failed, and irregularities raised questions about the trial’s reliability. The authors admitted mistakes and agreed to the retraction, while editors stressed the importance of transparency and warned against citing the discredited findings.</description>

      <description>Zeaxanthin, best known for eye health, has been found to boost the tumor-killing power of T cells. Researchers showed it strengthens T-cell receptors, enhances immune signaling, and improves the effects of immunotherapy. Found naturally in foods like spinach and peppers, it’s safe, accessible, and now a promising candidate for cancer treatment trials.</description>

      <title>Before they sucked blood, leeches were ocean hunters</title>

      <description>A 430-million-year-old fossil has rewritten leech history, showing they are at least 200 million years older than previously believed. Unlike today’s bloodsucking leeches, their ancient ancestors likely hunted small marine animals using a tail sucker rather than piercing skin.</description>

      <title>1,000 Swiss glaciers already gone, and the melting is speeding up</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092211.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092211.htm</guid>
      <description>Swiss glaciers lost nearly 3% of their volume in 2025, following a snow-poor winter and scorching summer heatwaves. The melt has been so extreme that some glaciers lost more than two meters of ice thickness in a single season. Scientists caution that the decline is destabilizing mountains, raising risks of rock and ice avalanches. Long-term monitoring efforts are now more critical than ever.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092210.htm</guid>
      <description>Fresh analysis of Cassini data has revealed new complex organic molecules inside ice grains spewing from Enceladus. These discoveries strengthen the case that the moon’s underground ocean hosts chemistry similar to life’s building blocks on Earth. Scientists now believe Enceladus could be habitable, and plans are underway for a European mission to sample its surface and jets.</description>

      <title>The billion-year reign of fungi that predated plants and made Earth livable</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092208.htm</guid>
      <description>Fungi may have shaped Earth’s landscapes long before plants appeared. By combining rare gene transfers with fossil evidence, researchers have traced fungal origins back nearly a billion years earlier than expected. These ancient fungi may have partnered with algae, recycling nutrients, breaking down rock, and creating primitive soils. Far from being silent background players, fungi were ecosystem engineers that prepared Earth’s surface for plants, fundamentally altering the course of life’s history.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092204.htm</guid>
      <description>A powerful new AI tool called Diag2Diag is revolutionizing fusion research by filling in missing plasma data with synthetic yet highly detailed information. Developed by Princeton scientists and international collaborators, this system uses sensor input to predict readings other diagnostics can’t capture, especially in the crucial plasma edge region where stability determines performance. By reducing reliance on bulky hardware, it promises to make future fusion reactors more compact, affordable, and reliable.</description>

      <description>For decades, Uranus baffled scientists because it seemed to have no internal heat. Now, new computer modeling shows the planet actually emits more energy than it receives from the Sun. This subtle warmth suggests Uranus’ story is more complex than previously thought, offering fresh clues about its violent past and about exoplanets similar in size.</description>

      <description>A comprehensive review shows that yoga doesn’t match up to traditional exercise for improving vascular health. Activities like Pilates, Tai Chi, and interval training prove more effective in keeping arteries resilient, especially in sedentary adults. While yoga remains valuable for accessibility and cultural significance, experts say it should be supplemented with more vigorous activity to fully protect heart health.</description>

      <description>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope are unraveling the mysteries of TRAPPIST-1e, an Earth-sized exoplanet 40 light years away that could harbor liquid water. Early data suggests hints of an atmosphere, but much remains uncertain. Researchers have already ruled out a hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere, pointing instead to the possibility of a secondary atmosphere that could sustain oceans or ice.</description>
