      <description>BMJ Group has pulled a widely reported apple cider vinegar weight-loss study after experts uncovered major flaws in its data and analysis. Attempts to replicate the results failed, and irregularities raised questions about the trial’s reliability. The authors admitted mistakes and agreed to the retraction, while editors stressed the importance of transparency and warned against citing the discredited findings.</description>

      <description>Zeaxanthin, best known for eye health, has been found to boost the tumor-killing power of T cells. Researchers showed it strengthens T-cell receptors, enhances immune signaling, and improves the effects of immunotherapy. Found naturally in foods like spinach and peppers, it’s safe, accessible, and now a promising candidate for cancer treatment trials.</description>

      <title>The billion-year reign of fungi that predated plants and made Earth livable</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092208.htm</guid>
      <description>Fungi may have shaped Earth’s landscapes long before plants appeared. By combining rare gene transfers with fossil evidence, researchers have traced fungal origins back nearly a billion years earlier than expected. These ancient fungi may have partnered with algae, recycling nutrients, breaking down rock, and creating primitive soils. Far from being silent background players, fungi were ecosystem engineers that prepared Earth’s surface for plants, fundamentally altering the course of life’s history.</description>

      <title>Princeton’s AI reveals what fusion sensors can’t see</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092204.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092204.htm</guid>
      <description>A powerful new AI tool called Diag2Diag is revolutionizing fusion research by filling in missing plasma data with synthetic yet highly detailed information. Developed by Princeton scientists and international collaborators, this system uses sensor input to predict readings other diagnostics can’t capture, especially in the crucial plasma edge region where stability determines performance. By reducing reliance on bulky hardware, it promises to make future fusion reactors more compact, affordable, and reliable.</description>

      <title>Scientists just solved Uranus’ coldest mystery</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250930034246.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250930034246.htm</guid>
      <description>For decades, Uranus baffled scientists because it seemed to have no internal heat. Now, new computer modeling shows the planet actually emits more energy than it receives from the Sun. This subtle warmth suggests Uranus’ story is more complex than previously thought, offering fresh clues about its violent past and about exoplanets similar in size.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250930034240.htm</guid>
      <description>A comprehensive review shows that yoga doesn’t match up to traditional exercise for improving vascular health. Activities like Pilates, Tai Chi, and interval training prove more effective in keeping arteries resilient, especially in sedentary adults. While yoga remains valuable for accessibility and cultural significance, experts say it should be supplemented with more vigorous activity to fully protect heart health.</description>

      <description>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope are unraveling the mysteries of TRAPPIST-1e, an Earth-sized exoplanet 40 light years away that could harbor liquid water. Early data suggests hints of an atmosphere, but much remains uncertain. Researchers have already ruled out a hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere, pointing instead to the possibility of a secondary atmosphere that could sustain oceans or ice.</description>

      <description>Perseverance rover data shows Jezero Crater once held a calm lake, leaving behind mudstones rich in organic-linked minerals. The presence of iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide nodules suggests processes resembling microbial activity on Earth. Scientists caution that only Earth-based labs can confirm their true origin, but the samples collected may hold the strongest evidence yet of ancient Martian life.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250930034200.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have discovered that pollen is a hidden source of natural medicine for honeybees. Symbiotic bacteria called Streptomyces produce antimicrobial compounds that fight deadly bee and plant pathogens. Bees collect these bacteria along with pollen and store them in hives, creating a natural defense system. This could lead to new, sustainable ways of protecting both pollinators and crops.</description>

      <description>Tokyo residents face a trade-off between home size and commute time when it comes to sleep health. A new study shows longer commutes increase both insomnia and daytime sleepiness, while smaller housing also raises insomnia risk. Even with average-sized homes, commuting more than 52 minutes pushed people into the insomnia range. Researchers say smarter housing planning could improve both sleep and quality of life.</description>
