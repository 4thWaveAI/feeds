    <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm"/>

    <summary type="text">A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</summary>

    <title>Multiple hydrogen bonds as tools to enhance the mechanical and mechanoresponsive properties of polymers - Polymer Journal</title>
    <link href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41428-025-01098-6"/>
    <id>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41428-025-01098-6</id>
    <summary type="text">This review delineates a design strategy for mechanoresponsive polymers by categorizing hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) motifs into “rigid” and “flexible” types. Rigid H-bonds, with strong directionality, provide high elasticity and strength. In contrast, flexible H-bonds, such as aliphatic diols, possess multiple, conformationally diverse binding modes. This flexibility allows for more efficient energy dissipation and network recovery under strain, leading to materials with superior dynamicity. We discuss the intrinsic effects of structural flexibility of H-bonding groups on mechanical properties, independent of solvent interactions.</summary>
