    <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</summary>

    <summary type="text">Artificial nanocelluloses are produced via the self-assembly of low-molecular-weight (LMW) cellulose in vitro and represent an emerging class of nanocelluloses developed over the past decade. Most artificial nanocelluloses reported to date are particulates. We have developed two types of nanostructured macroscopic materials through the self-assembly of LMW cellulose: nanoribbon network hydrogels and nanospiked microfibrous materials. This Focus Review summarizes our work along with related studies on these novel nanostructured cellulose materials.</summary>
