    <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</summary>
