    <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm"/>

    <summary type="text">A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</summary>

    <title>An in-situ self-gelation photothermal alginate-based sponge dressing for rapid and effective wound management - NPG Asia Materials</title>
    <link href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-025-00620-9"/>
    <id>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-025-00620-9</id>
    <summary type="text">This work reports a self-gelating alginate sponge (Alg-BA@PDA) engineered by introducing 3-Aminobenzeneboronic acid groups and polydopamine nanoparticles. Hydroxyl groups on alginate chains dynamically crosslink with BA to form boronate ester networks, enabling rapid in situ gelation and conformal wound coverage. PDA-NPs endows the sponge with photothermal activity, antibacterial function, and ROS scavenging capacity, while also mitigating nanoparticle cytotoxicity through controlled release. Together, these features suppress inflammation, enhance angiogenesis, and promote collagen deposition. In vivo, the multifunctional Alg-BA@PDA sponge markedly accelerates full-thickness skin wound healing, highlighting its promise as a next-generation wound dressing.</summary>

    <title>Effect of the introduction of imide groups on the phase structure of cured epoxy/reactive oligomers with flexible chains - Polymer Journal</title>

    <summary type="text">The introduction of imide groups into reactive oligomers containing long-chain aliphatic structures improved their compatibility with biphenyl-type epoxy resins. UV‒vis spectroscopy revealed the presence of intermolecular charge-transfer interactions between the biphenyl and imide groups. Cured epoxy blends containing the imide-based reactive oligomer exhibited smaller phase-separated structures than blends containing the imide-free reactive oligomer. It was found that the compatibility of the reactive oligomers influences the size of the phase-separated structures in the cured epoxy resins.</summary>
