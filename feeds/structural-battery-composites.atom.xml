    <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>

    <summary type="text">A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</summary>

    <title>Multiple hydrogen bonds as tools to enhance the mechanical and mechanoresponsive properties of polymers - Polymer Journal</title>
    <link href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41428-025-01098-6"/>
    <id>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41428-025-01098-6</id>
    <summary type="text">This review delineates a design strategy for mechanoresponsive polymers by categorizing hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) motifs into “rigid” and “flexible” types. Rigid H-bonds, with strong directionality, provide high elasticity and strength. In contrast, flexible H-bonds, such as aliphatic diols, possess multiple, conformationally diverse binding modes. This flexibility allows for more efficient energy dissipation and network recovery under strain, leading to materials with superior dynamicity. We discuss the intrinsic effects of structural flexibility of H-bonding groups on mechanical properties, independent of solvent interactions.</summary>

    <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism - Nature Communications</title>
    <link href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62707-9"/>
    <id>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62707-9</id>
    <summary type="text">In open nonequilibrium systems, interactions that break the action-reaction symmetry are ubiquitous in nature. While such nonreciprocal interactions have been implemented for quantum systems, they typically require fine microscopic control of dissipation. Here, Hanai, Ootsuki and Tazai propose a dissipation engineering scheme that induces nonreciprocal interactions in solid state materials, giving rise to a persistent many-body chase-and-runaway dynamics of magnetism in layered ferromagnets.</summary>

    <summary type="text">HMEs (heat and moisture exchangers) are employed in clinical practice to humidify the inspired air in intubated patients. We aimed to develop and experimentally validate a mass based model describing the water input-output equilibrium in the presence of HMEs. The model should serve as a universally applicable basis for the evaluation of the fundamental HME humidification properties performance (mg reversibly stored per breath) and efficiency. A plug flow model was designed using three different locations (gas inlet, moisture benefit and water output) for inspiratory-expiratory flow and humidity measurements. We developed a complete set of algorithms for the calculation of all relevant metrics. Measurements also assessed humidity dependent volume changes. We proved the concept through the v</summary>
