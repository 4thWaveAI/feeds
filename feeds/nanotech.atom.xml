    <summary type="text">PFAS are fluorinated compounds found in many everyday products, such as outdoor clothing and cookware like Teflon pans. This is because PFAS are durable, heat-resistant and dirt-repellent. Their stability is precisely what leads to problems: although potentially harmful to our health, these substances are scarcely broken down at all in the environment and are regarded as &quot;forever chemicals.&quot; PFAS are also found in wastewater. Although they can be removed by filtration, this is a laborious process.</summary>
