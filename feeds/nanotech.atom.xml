    <summary type="text">High-density lipoproteins (HDL), also known as &quot;good cholesterol,&quot; remove excess cholesterol from the body&#x27;s tissues and transport it to the liver. This process is known to prevent atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque in the walls of arteries. Atherosclerosis is associated with deadly symptoms, including heart attacks, strokes, aneurysms, and blood clots. Despite the importance of HDLs, scientists still have a limited understanding of how they are made.</summary>
