      "content_text": "A powerful new AI tool called Diag2Diag is revolutionizing fusion research by filling in missing plasma data with synthetic yet highly detailed information. Developed by Princeton scientists and international collaborators, this system uses sensor input to predict readings other diagnostics can’t capture, especially in the crucial plasma edge region where stability determines performance. By reducing reliance on bulky hardware, it promises to make future fusion reactors more compact, affordable, and reliable.",
