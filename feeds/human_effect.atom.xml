    <title>Array-scale MUT simulations powered by the cloud</title>
    <link href="https://events.bizzabo.com/764786"/>
    <id>https://events.bizzabo.com/764786</id>
    <summary type="text">Designing and optimizing ultrasound transducers‚Äîwhether PMUTs or CMUTs‚Äîrequires accuracy at scale. 
    
    Yet traditional simulation approaches are often constrained to individual cells or limited structures, leaving important array-level effects poorly understood until expensive and time-consuming testing begins. 
    
    This gap can lead to longer development cycles and higher risk of failed devices.
    
    In this webinar, we will introduce the improved approach: full array-scale MUT simulations with fully coupled multiphysics. 
    
    By leveraging Quanscient‚Äôs cloud-native platform, engineers can model entire transducer arrays with all relevant physical interactions (electrical, mechanical, acoustic, and more) capturing system-level behaviors such as beam patterns and cross-t</summary>

    <summary type="text">In this webinar, we will explore efficient, accurate, and scalable techniques for analog and mixed-signal device testing using reconfigurable test setups. As semiconductor devices grow more complex, engineers face the challenge of validating performance and catching edge cases under tight schedules. Test setups often include oscilloscopes, waveform generators, network analyzers, and more, potentially from different vendors with unique automation and configuration considerations. In order to keep pace with semiconductor validation requirements, multi-channel test setups designed for flexibility and performance can help engineers scale effectively.

    - Reducing signal path complexity with multiple integrated instruments
    - Improving data fidelity when measur</summary>

    <summary type="text">This¬†Used Heavy- Duty Vehicles and the Environment: A Global Overview of Used Heavy-Duty Vehicles: Flow, Scale and Regulation¬†report analyses the flow and scale of used heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) from three major used HDVs exporters ‚Äì Japan, the European Union (EU) and Republic of Korea (ROK). It also reviews the regulatory environment for used HDVs import in 146 countries, 122 of which are low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). The major exporters of HDVs (used &amp; new) are the EU, Japan, Republic of Korea (ROK), Mexico, the US, and China. However, while China manufactures 67% of global HDVs, its share of used HDV exports was only 8% in 2020. This is changing rapidly as the policy to expand used vehicles exports is being implemented and from 2022 more than 30 cities in China have been a</summary>
