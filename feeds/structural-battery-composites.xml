      <description>Artificial intelligence is consuming enormous amounts of energy, but researchers at the University of Florida have built a chip that could change everything by using light instead of electricity for a core AI function. By etching microscopic lenses directly onto silicon, they’ve enabled laser-powered computations that cut power use dramatically while maintaining near-perfect accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm</link>

      <description>A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</description>

      <description>As electric vehicles grow more popular, their warning sounds may not be doing enough to protect pedestrians. A Swedish study shows that these signals are hard to locate, especially when multiple vehicles are involved, leaving people unable to tell where danger is coming from or how many cars are nearby.</description>

      <description>Researchers have discovered that the mixing of small particles between two solid electrolytes can generate an effect called a &amp;apos;space charge layer,&amp;apos; an accumulation of electric charge at the interface between the two materials. The finding could aid the development of batteries with solid electrolytes, called solid-state batteries, for applications including mobile devices and electric vehicles.</description>

      <description>Charge-selective contacts have a key role in increasing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A hole-transport material (HTM) is designed based on a symmetric aromatic molecule that facilitates long-range ordered π–π stacking on substrates. This HTM shows enhanced charge-transport properties, and when incorporated into PSCs, helps to deliver good efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>An in-situ self-gelation photothermal alginate-based sponge dressing for rapid and effective wound management - NPG Asia Materials</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-025-00620-9</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-025-00620-9</guid>
      <description>This work reports a self-gelating alginate sponge (Alg-BA@PDA) engineered by introducing 3-Aminobenzeneboronic acid groups and polydopamine nanoparticles. Hydroxyl groups on alginate chains dynamically crosslink with BA to form boronate ester networks, enabling rapid in situ gelation and conformal wound coverage. PDA-NPs endows the sponge with photothermal activity, antibacterial function, and ROS scavenging capacity, while also mitigating nanoparticle cytotoxicity through controlled release. Together, these features suppress inflammation, enhance angiogenesis, and promote collagen deposition. In vivo, the multifunctional Alg-BA@PDA sponge markedly accelerates full-thickness skin wound healing, highlighting its promise as a next-generation wound dressing.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-025-00619-2</guid>
      <description>This work demonstrates super colossal barocaloric effect in one of the “simplest” materials—H2O, with a reversible entropy change as much as 728 J·kg-1·K-1 under a small pressure 0.1 GPa by adding a little amount of GdCl3. Neutron combined with molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism and inferred that H-bond engineering can be an attractive approach for designing novel caloric materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of the introduction of imide groups on the phase structure of cured epoxy/reactive oligomers with flexible chains - Polymer Journal</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41428-025-01102-z</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41428-025-01102-z</guid>
      <description>The introduction of imide groups into reactive oligomers containing long-chain aliphatic structures improved their compatibility with biphenyl-type epoxy resins. UV‒vis spectroscopy revealed the presence of intermolecular charge-transfer interactions between the biphenyl and imide groups. Cured epoxy blends containing the imide-based reactive oligomer exhibited smaller phase-separated structures than blends containing the imide-free reactive oligomer. It was found that the compatibility of the reactive oligomers influences the size of the phase-separated structures in the cured epoxy resins.</description>
