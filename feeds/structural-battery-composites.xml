      <description>Artificial intelligence is consuming enormous amounts of energy, but researchers at the University of Florida have built a chip that could change everything by using light instead of electricity for a core AI function. By etching microscopic lenses directly onto silicon, they’ve enabled laser-powered computations that cut power use dramatically while maintaining near-perfect accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>

      <description>A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</description>

      <description>As electric vehicles grow more popular, their warning sounds may not be doing enough to protect pedestrians. A Swedish study shows that these signals are hard to locate, especially when multiple vehicles are involved, leaving people unable to tell where danger is coming from or how many cars are nearby.</description>

      <description>Researchers have discovered that the mixing of small particles between two solid electrolytes can generate an effect called a &amp;apos;space charge layer,&amp;apos; an accumulation of electric charge at the interface between the two materials. The finding could aid the development of batteries with solid electrolytes, called solid-state batteries, for applications including mobile devices and electric vehicles.</description>

      <description>Researchers present new experimental and theoretical results for the bound electron g-factor in lithium-like tin which has a much higher nuclear charge than any previous measurement. The experimental accuracy reached a level of 0.5 parts per billion. Using an enhanced interelectronic QED method, the theoretical prediction for the g-factor reached a precision of 6 parts per billion.</description>

      <description>Lightweight, powerful lithium-ion batteries are crucial for the transition to electric vehicles, and global demand for lithium is set to grow rapidly over the next 25 years. A new analysis looks at how new mining operations and battery recycling could meet that demand. Recycling could play a big role in easing supply constraints, the researchers found.</description>

      <title>Imaging isospin order in rhombohedral graphene reveals anisotropy in correlated states - Nature Physics</title>

      <description>The microscopic magnetic textures of isospin symmetry-broken phases in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene have been directly imaged. By probing spin orientation and magnetic anisotropy at ultra-low fields, key energy scales — the spin–orbit coupling and intervalley Hund’s exchange — have been extracted, shedding new light on the phase hierarchy in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <description>Voltage instability of battery materials has hindered the realization of high-voltage all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Now, 5 V-class ASSBs are enabled by a fluoride-based shielding layer, LiCl–4Li2TiF6, that combines high oxidative stability and Li+ conductivity. Applied to high-voltage cathodes, the shielding layer mitigates interfacial degradation and enables stable cycling at &amp;gt;5 V, including under high-capacity conditions.</description>
