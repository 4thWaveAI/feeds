      <description>Artificial intelligence is consuming enormous amounts of energy, but researchers at the University of Florida have built a chip that could change everything by using light instead of electricity for a core AI function. By etching microscopic lenses directly onto silicon, they’ve enabled laser-powered computations that cut power use dramatically while maintaining near-perfect accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scientists discover salt that makes batteries last 10x longer</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250726234421.htm</guid>
      <description>A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to &amp;quot;free water&amp;quot; molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</description>

      <description>As electric vehicles grow more popular, their warning sounds may not be doing enough to protect pedestrians. A Swedish study shows that these signals are hard to locate, especially when multiple vehicles are involved, leaving people unable to tell where danger is coming from or how many cars are nearby.</description>

      <description>Researchers have discovered that the mixing of small particles between two solid electrolytes can generate an effect called a &amp;apos;space charge layer,&amp;apos; an accumulation of electric charge at the interface between the two materials. The finding could aid the development of batteries with solid electrolytes, called solid-state batteries, for applications including mobile devices and electric vehicles.</description>

      <description>Researchers present new experimental and theoretical results for the bound electron g-factor in lithium-like tin which has a much higher nuclear charge than any previous measurement. The experimental accuracy reached a level of 0.5 parts per billion. Using an enhanced interelectronic QED method, the theoretical prediction for the g-factor reached a precision of 6 parts per billion.</description>

      <description>Efficient, low-cost removal of trace per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from water is challenging to achieve. Low-pressure adsorptive membranes that are easy to regenerate have great potential for removing trace contaminants such as PFASs from aqueous systems.</description>

      <description>Topologically protected states in a photonic crystal can prevent backscattering of light, but creating these states requires the photonic crystal to be engineered to break time-reversal symmetry. Major strides have been taken towards this goal using a photonic crystal driven by a circularly polarized laser.</description>
