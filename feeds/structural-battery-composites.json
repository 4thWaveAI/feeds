By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.",

PDA-NPs endows the sponge with photothermal activity, antibacterial function, and ROS scavenging capacity, while also mitigating nanoparticle cytotoxicity through controlled release. Together, these features suppress inflammation, enhance angiogenesis, and promote collagen deposition. In vivo, the multifunctional Alg-BA@PDA sponge markedly accelerates full-thickness skin wound healing, highlighting its promise as a next-generation wound dressing.",
