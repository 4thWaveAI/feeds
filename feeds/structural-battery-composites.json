By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.",

Rigid H-bonds, with strong directionality, provide high elasticity and strength. In contrast, flexible H-bonds, such as aliphatic diols, possess multiple, conformationally diverse binding modes. This flexibility allows for more efficient energy dissipation and network recovery under strain, leading to materials with superior dynamicity. We discuss the intrinsic effects of structural flexibility of H-bonding groups on mechanical properties, independent of solvent interactions.",
