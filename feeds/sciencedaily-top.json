      "content_text": "Scientists have developed a lens-free mid-infrared camera using a modern twist on pinhole imaging. The system uses nonlinear crystals to convert infrared light into visible, allowing standard sensors to capture sharp, wide-range images without distortion. It can also create precise 3D reconstructions even in extremely low light. Though still experimental, the technology promises affordable, portable infrared imaging for safety, industrial, and environmental uses.",
