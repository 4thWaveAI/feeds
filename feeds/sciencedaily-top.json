      "content_text": "Despite strong evidence that salt substitutes can safely lower sodium intake and reduce high blood pressure, very few Americans use them. A new analysis of nearly 20 years of national health data found that usage peaked at just over 5% and then declined, even among those with hypertension. Researchers say this represents a major missed opportunity to improve heart health, especially since salt substitutes are inexpensive and effective.",

      "content_text": "For decades, scientists have puzzled over why smoking makes Crohn’s disease worse but seems to protect people from ulcerative colitis. Now, researchers at RIKEN have discovered that smoking creates metabolites like hydroquinone that allow mouth bacteria—especially Streptococcus mitis—to settle in the gut. These bacteria spark an immune response that reduces inflammation in colitis but worsens Crohn’s. The findings open the door to new therapies using probiotics or targeted compounds that mimic smoking’s protective effects without its deadly risks.",
