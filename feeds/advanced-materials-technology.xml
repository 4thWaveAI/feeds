      <title>Graphene just broke a fundamental law of physics</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250912081319.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250912081319.htm</guid>
      <description>For the first time, scientists have observed electrons in graphene behaving like a nearly perfect quantum fluid, challenging a long-standing puzzle in physics. By creating ultra-clean samples, the team at IISc uncovered a surprising decoupling of heat and charge transport, shattering the traditional Wiedemann-Franz law. At the mysterious “Dirac point,” graphene electrons flowed like an exotic liquid similar to quark-gluon plasma, with ultra-low viscosity. Beyond rewriting physics textbooks, this discovery opens new avenues for studying black holes and quantum entanglement in the lab—and may even power next-gen quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>These clear windows can secretly produce solar power</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250905112312.htm</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250905112312.htm</guid>
      <description>Scientists have created a transparent solar coating that turns ordinary windows into clean energy generators without affecting clarity. Using cholesteric liquid crystal layers, the coating redirects polarized sunlight to the window edges where solar cells collect it. A small prototype already powered a fan, and full-sized windows could boost efficiency 50-fold while cutting the need for costly photovoltaic cells.</description>
