    <summary type="text">Physicists are eyeing charged gravitinos—ultra-heavy, stable particles from supergravity theory—as possible Dark Matter candidates. Unlike axions or WIMPs, these particles carry electric charge but remain undetectable due to their scarcity. With detectors like JUNO and DUNE, researchers now have a chance to spot their unique signal, a breakthrough that could link particle physics with gravity.</summary>

    <title>Hidden bacterial molecules in the brain reveal new secrets of sleep</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025336.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025336.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">New studies show that a bacterial molecule, peptidoglycan, is present in the brain and fluctuates with sleep patterns. This challenges the idea that sleep is solely brain-driven, instead suggesting it’s a collaborative process between our bodies and microbiomes. The theory links microbes not only to sleep but also to cognition, appetite, and behavior, pointing to a profound evolutionary relationship.</summary>

    <title>Brain fat, not just plaques, may be the hidden driver of Alzheimer’s</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012257.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">For decades, scientists believed Alzheimer’s was driven mainly by sticky protein plaques and tangles in the brain. Now Purdue researchers have revealed a hidden culprit: fat. They found that brain immune cells can become clogged with fat, leaving them too weak to fight off disease. By clearing out this fat and restoring the cells’ defenses, researchers may have uncovered an entirely new way to combat Alzheimer’s — shifting the focus from plaques alone to how the brain handles fat.</summary>
