    <title>This “chaos enzyme” may hold the key to stopping cancer spread</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251004092858.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251004092858.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">A Weill Cornell Medicine team has found that triple-negative breast cancer depends on the enzyme EZH2 to spread. By silencing key genes, EZH2 drives chaotic cell divisions and fuels metastasis. Blocking EZH2 restored stability and prevented cancer cells from traveling to distant organs. This discovery opens the door to new therapies that may finally tame this aggressive disease.</summary>

    <summary type="text">Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects over a third of the global population and is linked to serious health problems. A new study has revealed that high blood pressure, diabetes, and low HDL cholesterol are the deadliest cardiometabolic risk factors for patients with MASLD, with high blood pressure proving to be even riskier than diabetes. The findings also show that obesity and body mass index significantly influence mortality, and that each additional risk factor compounds the danger.</summary>
