    <title>Shocking study exposes widespread math research fraud</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918230811.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918230811.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">A sweeping investigation has revealed widespread fraud in mathematics publishing, where commercial metrics and rankings have incentivized the mass production of meaningless or flawed papers. The study highlights shocking distortions—such as a university without a math department ranked as having the most top mathematicians—and the explosion of megajournals willing to publish anything for a fee.</summary>

    <title>Scientists finally reveal the hidden mechanism linking alcohol to fatty liver</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225020.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225020.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Mayo Clinic scientists uncovered how excessive drinking triggers fatty liver disease by disrupting the enzyme VCP, which normally prevents harmful protein buildup on fat droplets in the liver. Alcohol blocks this protective process, allowing fat to accumulate and damage liver cells.</summary>

    <title>Alcohol’s hidden shortcut lets gut bacteria wreck the liver</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Alcohol-associated liver disease is becoming a massive health and economic burden, but researchers at UC San Diego may have uncovered a new way forward. They discovered that chronic alcohol use blocks a crucial protein that normally helps keep gut bacteria from leaking into the liver, worsening damage. Restoring this protein’s function, using drugs already in development, could not only reduce liver disease but also have implications for treating alcohol addiction itself.</summary>
