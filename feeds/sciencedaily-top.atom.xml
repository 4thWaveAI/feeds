    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085237.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Despite strong evidence that salt substitutes can safely lower sodium intake and reduce high blood pressure, very few Americans use them. A new analysis of nearly 20 years of national health data found that usage peaked at just over 5% and then declined, even among those with hypertension. Researchers say this represents a major missed opportunity to improve heart health, especially since salt substitutes are inexpensive and effective.</summary>

    <title>Smoking’s hidden gut bacteria trick may lead to new colitis treatments</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085235.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085235.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">For decades, scientists have puzzled over why smoking makes Crohn’s disease worse but seems to protect people from ulcerative colitis. Now, researchers at RIKEN have discovered that smoking creates metabolites like hydroquinone that allow mouth bacteria—especially Streptococcus mitis—to settle in the gut. These bacteria spark an immune response that reduces inflammation in colitis but worsens Crohn’s. The findings open the door to new therapies using probiotics or targeted compounds that mimic smoking’s protective effects without its deadly risks.</summary>

    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225018.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Alcohol-associated liver disease is becoming a massive health and economic burden, but researchers at UC San Diego may have uncovered a new way forward. They discovered that chronic alcohol use blocks a crucial protein that normally helps keep gut bacteria from leaking into the liver, worsening damage. Restoring this protein’s function, using drugs already in development, could not only reduce liver disease but also have implications for treating alcohol addiction itself.</summary>
