    <title>Brain rhythms reveal a secret switch between old memories and new adventures</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221819.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250916221819.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Scientists have uncovered how the brain reroutes its communication pathways depending on whether it’s processing something new or recalling the familiar. By fine-tuning the balance between different inhibitory circuits, the brain flexibly shifts between reactivating stored memories and integrating fresh sensory input. This discovery not only reshapes our understanding of brain rhythms but also opens new doors for exploring how attention, cognition, and even neurological disorders like epilepsy or Alzheimer’s may emerge from disrupted balance.</summary>
