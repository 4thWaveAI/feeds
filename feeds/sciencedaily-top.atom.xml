    <title>Why “dry” oil wells aren’t really empty</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031239.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031239.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Oil wells often dry up far earlier than predicted, leaving companies baffled about the “missing” reserves. A Penn State team tackled this puzzle by harnessing PSC’s Bridges-2 supercomputer, adding a time dimension and amplitude analysis to traditional seismic data. Their findings revealed hidden rock structures blocking oil flow, meaning reserves weren’t gone—they were trapped.</summary>

    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031227.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Living with a sense of purpose may not just enrich life, it could also guard against dementia. A UC Davis study tracking over 13,000 adults for up to 15 years found that people with higher purpose were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment. Purpose was linked to resilience across ethnicities, even in those with genetic risks for Alzheimer’s, and activities like relationships, volunteering, spirituality, and personal goals can help nurture it.</summary>

    <title>Autism may be the price of human intelligence</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031224.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031224.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Researchers discovered that autism’s prevalence may be linked to human brain evolution. Specific neurons in the outer brain evolved rapidly, and autism-linked genes changed under natural selection. These shifts may have slowed brain development in children while boosting language and cognition. The findings suggest autism is part of the trade-off that made humans so cognitively advanced.</summary>

    <title>Hidden Alzheimer’s warning signs found in Parkinson’s patients without dementia</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031217.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031217.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Researchers in Japan discovered that Parkinson’s patients diagnosed in their 80s are far more likely to show signs of amyloid buildup, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, even without dementia symptoms. The study compared younger and older patients, finding that older individuals had three times the rate of amyloid positivity. Surprisingly, Parkinson’s patients overall showed lower amyloid buildup than healthy people their age, suggesting that Parkinson’s might change the way Alzheimer’s-related processes unfold in the brain.</summary>

    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031214.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Boston University researchers found that ordinary moments can gain staying power if they’re connected to significant emotional events. Using studies with hundreds of participants, they showed that the brain prioritizes fragile memories when they overlap with meaningful experiences. This could help explain why we recall certain details surrounding big events and may lead to new ways of boosting learning and treating memory disorders.</summary>

    <summary type="text">Ultra-processed foods make up the bulk of U.S. diets, and new research links high intake to inflammation, a predictor of heart disease. People consuming the most UPFs were far more likely to show elevated hs-CRP levels, especially older adults, smokers, and those with obesity. Scientists warn that UPFs may contribute to cancer and other chronic illnesses, urging stronger health policies despite pushback from powerful food companies.</summary>

    <title>Scientists uncover how to block pain without side effects</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035030.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250926035030.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Scientists have discovered a way to block pain while still allowing the body’s natural healing to take place. Current painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin often come with harmful side effects because they shut down both pain and inflammation. But this new research identified a single “pain switch” receptor that can be turned off without interfering with inflammation, which actually helps the body recover.</summary>
