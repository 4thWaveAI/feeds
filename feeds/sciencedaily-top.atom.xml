    <title>How gaslighting tricks the brain into questioning reality</title>
    <link href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092238.htm"/>
    <id>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251001092238.htm</id>
    <summary type="text">Gaslighting, often seen as a form of manipulation, has now been reframed by researchers at McGill University and the University of Toronto as a learning process rooted in how our brains handle prediction and surprise. Instead of merely being explained through outdated psychodynamic theories, this new model highlights how trust and close relationships can be exploited by manipulators who repeatedly undermine a person’s confidence in their own reality.</summary>
